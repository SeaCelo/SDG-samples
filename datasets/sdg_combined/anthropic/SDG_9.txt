A Roadmap for Sustainable Progress: How Investment in Industry and Infrastructure Can Drive Development  

By The Assistant  

As the world grapples with the challenges of the 21st century, from climate change to economic inequality, sustainable and inclusive industrialization and investment in resilient infrastructure have emerged as key priorities in the global development agenda. Sustainable Development Goal 9 aims to "build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation". Achieving this goal is crucial to making progress on other SDGs and improving lives around the world.

Investing in infrastructure, such as transportation, irrigation, energy and information and communication technology, is a proven method for driving economic growth and development. The UN estimates that every 1% increase in a country's infrastructure investment generates a 1% increase in GDP in the long run. However, infrastructure projects must be sustainable and resilient to climate change to reap the full benefits. The UN's Financing for Sustainable Development report recommends increasing public and private infrastructure investment globally, especially in developing countries. It also calls for using blended finance instruments to catalyze private sector investment in sustainable infrastructure.

Promoting inclusive and sustainable industrial development is also key to creating economic opportunity and prosperity. The manufacturing and industrial sectors are major sources of employment and economic mobility for workers with a range of skill levels. However, the gains from industrialization must be broadly shared across society regardless of gender, ethnicity or income. Industrialization must also minimize pollution and environmental degradation. The UN Industrial Development Organization assists countries in formulating and implementing sustainable industrial policies and strategies aligned with the SDGs.

Fostering innovation, especially technological innovation, fuels progress in infrastructure, industry and beyond. Innovation expands access to technologies that can improve lives, from medical devices to mobile banking. The UN supports countries in developing policy environments conducive to innovation, as well as improving access to technology and digital infrastructure. 

Achieving SDG 9 will require a coordinated effort across governments, the private sector, and civil society. By promoting sustainable infrastructure and industrialization, and fostering innovation, countries can drive economic growth, create jobs, and improve well-being for all people. Overall, investment in these areas is crucial to making progress on sustainable development that leaves no one behind.

SDG 9: Building Resilient Infrastructure and Promoting Inclusive Industrialization  

The ninth Sustainable Development Goal aims to "build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation". Infrastructure and industrialization are crucial drivers of economic growth and prosperity. When done sustainably, they can provide widespread benefits for both developed and developing countries.

According to the UN Secretary-General's latest SDG progress report, the world continues to urbanize rapidly, putting a strain on infrastructure and services in cities. The report calls for investment in sustainable transportation systems, renewable energy, and retrofitting of buildings to make cities more liveable and resilient. Many countries still lack access to reliable electricity and clean cooking fuels, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. Closing these access gaps will require trillions of dollars of investment in new renewable energy infrastructure over the next decade.  

On the industrialization front, global manufacturing output continues to grow steadily, but remains concentrated in certain regions. Countries in East and South Asia have robust manufacturing sectors, while industrialization in other parts of the world lags. The UN's DESA division advocates policies to promote inclusive and sustainable industrial development, such as incentivizing private sector investment in green industries, building human capital, and strengthening domestic supply chains. UNCTAD also supports developing countries in attracting higher-value foreign direct investment to boost their manufacturing and services exports.

While technology and innovation are expanding rapidly around the world, fueled by hubs like Silicon Valley in the US and Shenzhen in China, many countries still face barriers accessing new technologies and building their own innovation ecosystems. The UN's Technology Facilitation Mechanism aims to address this, by building partnerships between governments, civil society, academia and the private sector to catalyze the adoption of new technologies for sustainable development.  

Overall, significant investments in infrastructure and policy support for inclusive industrialization and innovation ecosystems will be required to achieve SDG 9 for all countries over the next decade. But building sustainable and resilient systems can drive economic opportunity, job creation and rising living standards across the world if done right. The UN system stands ready to support all countries in implementing this critical goal.

Building Infrastructure, Promoting Inclusive Industrialization and Fostering Innovation: Progress on SDG 9  

By Your AI Assistant

Sustainable Development Goal 9 focuses on three key areas vital for sustainable economic growth and development: infrastructure, industrialization and innovation. According to the latest UN progress report, the world is making steady improvements on SDG 9 but more needs to be done to achieve the ambitious targets by 2030.

On infrastructure, the world is slowly closing the infrastructure gap but huge financing shortfalls remain. An estimated $15 trillion is needed for infrastructure in developing countries between 2016 and 2030. The UN estimates a gap of $5 trillion to $7 trillion to achieve sustainable infrastructure for all. Countries and development banks have made infrastructure a priority but private sector investment also needs to increase. The Belt and Road Initiative by China is one ambitious infrastructure effort that aims to connect Asia, Africa and Europe through land and maritime routes.  

On industrialization, global manufacturing output and labor productivity are increasing but not at the scale or speed needed to double the share of manufacturing in least developed countries (LDCs). Manufacturing value added growth in LDCs was only 5.5% in 2016, far below the 9.2% annual growth rate needed to meet the SDG target. Additional investments in skills, research, technology and policy reforms are required to accelerate industrialization in poorer nations. Several African countries are diversifying into new industries with Ethiopia building its garment sector and Rwanda focusing on technology and innovation.   

Finally, on innovation, science and technology progress remains uneven across countries and regions. Research and development expenditure has grown globally but mostly in already advanced economies. Access to technology and the Internet has expanded but not fast enough to provide universal access by 2030. However, several developing countries are emerging as innovation leaders, including China, India and Brazil which account for an increasing share of global research and development. Artificial Intelligence, robotics, biotechnology and renewable energy are fast-growing innovative fields that need more investment and governance to ensure they benefit people in all countries.

While daunting challenges remain, the progress on SDG 9 shows the potential for new technologies, South-South cooperation and private sector partnerships to facilitate sustainable infrastructure, industrialization and innovation worldwide. By accelerating best practices and financing, especially in developing nations, the world can build the physical and intangible capital for a sustainable future for all.

UN Report Shows Slow Progress on Global Goal for Industry and Infrastructure

The United Nations released its latest report on the Sustainable Development Goals this week, showing uneven progress on Goal 9, which aims to "build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation." Established in 2015, the SDGs are a set of 17 ambitious targets for solving global challenges like poverty, inequality, and climate change by 2030. 

Goal 9 focuses on promoting sustainable and innovation-led economic growth through investments in infrastructure, industrialization and technological progress. However, the UN report found advancement on the goal's 12 targets has been slow and uneven across regions. Developing countries in Asia and Africa continue to face major infrastructure gaps, with billions still lacking access to basic services like electricity, sanitation, and transportation. Meanwhile, many advanced economies are struggling with the transition to greener, more sustainable industries and facing disruptions from technologies like AI and automation.

The report cited some bright spots, including increasing global spending on research and development, growth in renewable energy infrastructure, and rising internet access. But UN experts warned much more needs to be done to mobilize the estimated $6 trillion per year in infrastructure investment needed to achieve the goal. They called for policy reforms to improve private sector participation, curb corruption, and target spending at sustainable projects that can drive job creation and trade. New multilateral development banks and development finance institutions may also help mobilize funding by reducing risks for private investors.  

Progress on specific targets has been limited. Target 9.1 calls for developing sustainable and resilient infrastructure, but spending remains concentrated on high-carbon projects like coal plants and road expansion. Target 9.2 aims to promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, but manufacturing growth has stagnated in both rich and poor countries. And while some nations have had success with target 9.5 to enhance scientific research and technological capabilities, a "digital divide" persists with many developing countries lagging in areas like broadband access, education, and digital literacy.  

With only 10 years left to achieve the SDGs, accelerating progress on Goal 9 is crucial, the UN experts said. By investing in future-focused infrastructure and industries and harnessing innovations like AI for sustainable development, countries around the world can drive job creation, power economic opportunity and transition to greener economies. But they must act now to turn the vision of Goal 9 into a reality.

The Critical Mission of SDG 9: Building Sustainable Industry and Innovation

By Your Assistant

The 9th Sustainable Development Goal adopted by the UN in 2015 aims to promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation. This sweeping goal seeks to transform economies and societies through modernizing infrastructure, enhancing technological capabilities, and boosting scientific research across developing nations. With rapid population growth, urbanization, and technological change happening across the globe, SDG 9 has taken on new urgency. 

Industry is the foundation of economic growth, job creation and prosperity, but it must be sustainable and eco-friendly. SDG 9 calls for upgrading infrastructure and adapting industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes. The UN's 2019 SDG report found that CO2 emissions from the manufacturing and construction sectors continue to rise, highlighting the need for "greening" industries.

Access to financial services and innovation is also crucial. SDG 9 aims to facilitate sustainable and resilient infrastructure development through industrialization, foster innovation by enhancing scientific research, and encourage innovation through increased access to information and communications technology. However, major financing gaps remain in many developing countries for infrastructure and industry. The UN has called for closing these gaps through official development assistance, private investment, and development bank financing.  

Progress on SDG 9 has been slow, according to the UN, due to lack of private sector investment in sustainable industry and infrastructure. But new opportunities are emerging with advances in digital technologies. The digitization of production systems in the form of the "Fourth Industrial Revolution" could boost innovation and economic growth, especially in developing regions. But it also risks exacerbating inequality if technological progress disproportionately benefits higher-income countries and higher-skilled workers.

With only 10 years left to achieve the SDGs, SDG 9 deserves far greater priority and investment. Transitioning to sustainable industry and fostering innovation is essential for developing nations to build prosperous economies, create jobs, and improve standards of living, all while protecting the environment. Success will require a coordinated global effort across governments, private sector and international organizations to spur infrastructure development, industrialization, and technological progress across the developing world.


 Here is a draft OpEd in the style of Nicholas Kristof on Sustainable Development Goal 9:

The Innovation Imperative: Why SDG 9 Matters 

In a dusty village in central Tanzania, a group of schoolchildren are gathered around a small solar-powered laptop, accessing digital learning tools for the first time. In a suburb of Dhaka, Bangladesh, a woman is operating a 3D printer, creating low-cost prosthetic limbs that give mobility back to victims of accidents or war. In a favela in Sao Paulo, Brazil, residents are using an app on their phones to access affordable renewable energy for the first time, paying for it through mobile payments.

Around the world, innovation and infrastructure are transforming lives in ways big and small. That is why Sustainable Development Goal 9, which aims to "build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation," is so critical. We live in an era of dizzying technological change, with advancements in fields like artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and renewable energy that have the potential to solve some of humanity's greatest challenges—if we make the investments and policy decisions to guide these technologies towards the public good.

At its heart, SDG 9 is about enabling progress. It's about building the roads, bridges, ports, and transit systems that connect communities. It's about providing universal access to affordable, reliable sustainable energy and telecommunications. It's about promoting economic growth through industrialization, encouraging entrepreneurship and small businesses, and nurturing innovative new industries. It's about wisely governing emerging technologies so they improve lives rather than exacerbate inequality.

Progress on SDG 9 is uneven across countries and regions. Industrialized nations often have a head start, with existing infrastructure and policy frameworks for fostering innovation. But developing countries can leapfrog ahead in some areas, adopting renewable energy and advanced technologies without being locked into outdated systems. What's needed everywhere are increased investments in research and development, partnerships between governments, academia and private industry, and policies that spur commercialization of new technologies while protecting the public. 

There are bright spots, like the spread of mobile phones into some of the world's poorest and most remote communities, enabling access to information, financial tools and more. But nearly half the world's population still lacks access to basic sanitation, and 1 billion people live without electricity. Transportation and communication networks remain woefully underdeveloped in many parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America. 

With just over a decade left to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, we must accelerate progress on SDG 9. When journalists write the first draft of history, let that draft show how innovation and infrastructure in the 21st century were harnessed to build a future of shared progress and prosperity for all humankind. Our shared innovation imperative depends on it.


 Here is a draft Op-ed in the style of Paul Krugman on Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure):

The Industrial Revolution That the World Needs 

The world is in desperate need of an industrial revolution. Not the kind of revolution that pumps more carbon into the atmosphere or depletes natural resources, but a sustainable revolution in infrastructure and innovation that can lift billions out of poverty while respecting the planet. This is the vision of Sustainable Development Goal 9, and the world is falling behind.  

For decades, economists like myself have argued that sustainable and inclusive economic growth requires massive investments in infrastructure, research and development, and technological capabilities. Roads, railways, ports, and telecommunications are the arteries of commerce that connect people to jobs, education and healthcare. Investments in R&D and innovation have huge spillover effects, creating new industries and raising productivity across the board. And building up technological and engineering skills prepares a workforce for the jobs of the future.

Yet compared to the scale of the challenges we face, the world's investments in these areas remain woefully inadequate. Billions of people still lack access to basic infrastructure like roads, sanitation, and electrification. R&D spending as a share of GDP is stagnant or declining in many countries. And too few students are gaining the science, technology, engineering and math skills to build the industries of tomorrow. 

If we are to achieve SDG 9 and spark an industrial revolution for sustainable development, we need action at multiple levels. Governments must ramp up public spending on infrastructure to connect more people to economic opportunity. They should expand support for R&D, especially in critical areas like renewable energy, public health and sustainable transportation. And education systems everywhere need an overhaul to promote STEM fields and foster more technical and engineering talent. 

The private sector also has an important role to play, including through public-private partnerships to finance infrastructure and R&D. Companies should invest more in upgrading the skills of their workforces and deepening the pool of talent in their communities. And impact investors can help scale up promising new technologies that advance sustainability.

 make no mistake, achieving SDG 9 will require trillions of dollars of investment. But the costs of inaction are far greater. Without modern infrastructure, innovation and human capital, we cannot build a sustainable future for humanity and the planet. The industrial revolution we need is within our grasp if we have the collective will to seize it. The time for action is now. Our shared future depends on it.


 Here is a draft Op-ed in the style of Mark Whitehouse on Sustainable Development Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation:

The Future is Infrastructure

Infrastructure is the backbone of society and the economy. Roads and railways connect communities, ports and airports link countries and markets, energy grids power homes and businesses. When infrastructure works well, it facilitates trade, spurs innovation, improves standards of living, and helps lift people out of poverty. When it fails, it cuts communities off, stalls economic progress, and exacerbates inequality. 

Sustainable Development Goal 9 calls for investments in infrastructure that is sustainable, resilient, and promotes inclusive economic growth. It aims to "build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation". This goal recognizes that infrastructure shapes the trajectory of development and that how we choose to build infrastructure today will have consequences far into the future. Investing in high-quality infrastructure can unlock dynamic gains in productivity, competitiveness, and economic growth. It can connect people to jobs, education and healthcare. It makes societies more resilient by providing essential services in times of crisis.

However, infrastructure is too often an afterthought in development planning. Investments favor short-term gains over long-term vision. Projects are over budget, behind schedule, and under-deliver on promised benefits. Corruption and mismanagement result in wasted resources and crumbling infrastructure. Developing countries in particular struggle with huge infrastructure gaps that limit economic potential and place additional burdens on communities. According to UN estimates, the world needs to invest $90 trillion in sustainable infrastructure over the next 15 years to meet the SDGs. Yet there are too few viable projects in the pipeline and too little funding available.

What’s needed is a coordinated global effort to invest in high-quality, sustainable infrastructure. Governments should establish stronger policy and regulatory frameworks to attract private capital, curb inefficiencies and graft, and ensure social and environmental safeguards. Multilateral development banks can help scale up project preparation facilities to translate more ideas into bankable projects. Investors should take a longer view, recognizing the boost to returns if projects are sustainable and resilient. New technologies can help develop infrastructure that makes better use of resources and embeds resilience from the start.

The future prosperity and well-being of both developing and developed countries hinges on investments made in infrastructure today. When we build sustainable, inclusive infrastructure, we are building hope, opportunity and prosperity for generations to come. The future is quite literally shaped by the investments we make in infrastructure now. Let’s build it well.


 Here is a draft article on SDG 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation in the style of The Economist:

The infrastructure imperative 

Infrastructure is the backbone of any economy and society. Roads, railways, ports, telecommunications systems, and power grids are essential for mobility, connectivity, and providing basic services. As the world rapidly urbanizes, with 68% of the population projected to live in cities by 2050, infrastructure needs are rising exponentially. Developing economies in particular require massive investments to build resilient and sustainable infrastructure and foster inclusive industrialization and innovation. 

SDG 9 calls for building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation. Significant progress has been made on this front. According to the UN, the proportion of the rural population with access to an all-season road increased from 56% in 2000 to 62% in 2015. The number of air transport passengers carried worldwide more than doubled over the same period. Access to mobile networks reached 95% of the global population. However, much more needs to be done, especially in the developing world. Billions of people still lack access to basic infrastructure services. Over 800 million people have no access to electricity. 300 million have no access to drinking water.   And over 2.5 billion lack access to basic sanitation services.

Upgrading infrastructure in a sustainable manner is critical. New infrastructure should be climate-resilient and environmentally sound. Emissions from transport and industry are major contributors to climate change. New technologies like renewable energy, electric vehicles, and green construction materials must be deployed at a large scale. Developing countries also need support in adopting digital technologies and building digital infrastructure. The so-called “fourth industrial revolution” fueled by artificial intelligence risks leaving many behind without action. Innovation ecosystems need nurturing to unlock the economic and social benefits of technology.

International cooperation on infrastructure and industrialization is vital.  Institutions like the UN, World Bank and development banks have supported infrastructure investments across the developing world. But far greater ambition and cooperation is needed among governments, donors, philanthropists and the private sector. Global platforms can help match investors and projects. New financing mechanisms are needed as government funding alone will not suffice. With political will and collaboration, SDG 9 can be achieved, paving the way for sustainable economies and resilient societies. But the infrastructure gap must be closed soon before its impact on human development becomes too great. Building a sustainable future rests on building sustainable infrastructure today.


 Here is a draft article in the style of Harvard Business Review on Sustainable Development Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure:

The Infrastructure Imperative: Why SDG 9 Matters for Business 

Infrastructure is the backbone of modern economies and societies. Roads and railways enable the movement of goods and people. Energy systems power our communications, healthcare, education and commercial activities. Advances in industry and technological innovation drive economic growth, job creation, and improvements in living standards. 

Sustainable Development Goal 9 focuses on building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation. Achieving SDG 9 is essential for progress across all 17 Sustainable Development Goals and for enabling prosperous, sustainable and equitable economies and communities. For businesses, investing in infrastructure and innovation expands markets, enhances productivity and competitiveness, and creates new opportunities for growth.  

The scale of the infrastructure gap is enormous. According to the Global Infrastructure Hub, the world needs to invest $97 trillion in infrastructure by 2040 to support growth and development. The bulk of this investment is needed in developing countries. In the poorest countries, over 600 million people still lack access to electricity and improved sanitation. Billions lack access to basic road networks or internet connectivity. Closing these gaps requires mobilizing private and public sector finance and channeling investments into sustainable and resilient infrastructure. New technologies offer innovative solutions, such as renewable mini-grids and infrastructure sharing models. 

Advancing sustainable industrialization and innovation are also crucial. Manufacturing value added per capita in developed countries is over 7 times higher than in developing economies. Accelerating the growth of manufacturing and productive capacities in poorer countries can lead to job creation, rising incomes, and greater economic diversification. With the onset of the 4th industrial revolution, supporting innovation in new technologies like AI, 3D printing, and biotech is key to future competitiveness. Yet R&D spending as a percentage of GDP in most developing countries remains very low.  

Businesses have much to gain by supporting SDG 9. Infrastructure development opens new markets for goods and services and boosts productivity. Industrialization increases demand for resources, materials and products. Innovation creates pathways for new products and business models. Yet private sector involvement in sustainable infrastructure and industrial projects in developing countries remains limited. Blended finance instruments, risk mitigation tools and policy incentives are needed to spur greater business investment and engagement.

Partnerships across sectors and between developed and developing nations are essential to make progress on SDG 9. MDBs, private investors and businesses should work with governments to assess infrastructure needs, improve regulatory environments, and craft bankable projects, especially in poorer countries. Transfer of technologies and technical skills from advanced to emerging economies fuels industrial and technological catch-up. And international cooperation on innovation supports the diffusion of life-changing advancements in fields like health, education, and sustainable energy to those who need them most.

With concerted action, rapid gains can be made on SDG 9. Meeting infrastructure needs and fostering industrialization and innovation in developing countries can drive growth, create economic opportunity, and improve living standards for billions of people across the globe. Business has a key role to play in making progress toward this sustainable development goal a reality.


 Here is a draft long-form article in the style of Time Magazine on Sustainable Development Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure:

The Road to Resilient and Sustainable Industries

As the world races toward greater globalization and interconnectedness, reliable and sustainable industrialization, technological capacity, and infrastructure have never been more important. Sustainable Development Goal 9 aims to "build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation", which are crucial for boosting long-term economic growth, creating jobs, and improving standards of living across the world. 

Infrastructure is the backbone of any economy, providing essential services that enable economic and social activity. However, the world is facing an enormous infrastructure gap, with developing countries needing investments of $2-3 trillion per year between now and 2030 to meet basic infrastructure needs. The UN's 2019 SDG report found that services like safe drinking water, electricity, and internet access remain out of reach for billions of people. Upgrading infrastructure in sustainable ways, like improving public transit and energy efficiency, is critical to enabling prosperity while combating climate change.

Sustainable industrialization powers economic growth and job creation. The manufacturing and industry sector employs over 500 million people worldwide and comprises nearly 17% of global GDP. However, the sector's impact on the environment is enormous, producing over 20% of total greenhouse gas emissions and dumping pollutants that poison air, water and soil. Transitioning to sustainable production and consumption patterns, using resources more efficiently, and preventing pollution can significantly reduce the environmental toll. The UN's Technology Bank for the Least Developed Countries is working to strengthen science, technology and innovation in those nations.

Innovation drives progress in all areas of development. Breakthroughs in fields like renewable energy, transportation, agriculture and healthcare have the potential to improve standards of living around the world in a sustainable manner. However, rates of investment in research and development are low in many countries, especially the poorest. Increased support for startups, scientific research, and tech incubators will be key to developing solutions for many global challenges. According to the UN, strengthening public research institutions and promoting international research collaboration are among the ways countries are advancing innovation.

While the challenges ahead are monumental, collective action and partnership can build a sustainable path forward. SDG 9 aims to lay the groundwork for resilient, shared progress by improving access to basic infrastructure and services for all people, transitioning economies to sustainable production and consumption, and promoting innovation worldwide. By working together across borders, we can achieve the vision of a prosperous, equitable and greener future for humanity.


 Here is a draft of a long-form article on Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of Forbes:

The Key To Our Sustainable Future: Investing in Infrastructure and Innovation  

Sustainable Development Goal 9, focused on building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation, may just be the most important goal for the future of our planet. Infrastructure forms the backbone of any economy and society. Roads, bridges, railways, ports, and telecommunications allow people and goods to move efficiently. Access to clean water and modern energy allows for improved sanitation, healthcare, education and overall standard of living.  

According to the UN, over 2.6 billion people in developing countries do not have access to toilets or latrines. Nearly 1 billion people live more than 2 kilometers from an all-season road. Over 3 billion people still cook using highly-polluting fuels like kerosene, wood, and coal. Solving these infrastructure deficits would have an enormous impact. Studies show increasing access to basic infrastructure could significantly boost economic growth and development.  

Of course, simply building more infrastructure is not enough. We need sustainable, resilient and innovative infrastructure that supports a greener future. The UN's 2019 Sustainable Development Goals Report found that while we are making some progress, more work is urgently needed. Countries must encourage investment in sustainable infrastructure, raise capacity for sustainability planning and promotion of sustainable industrialization. New concepts like 'green infrastructure', 'eco-industrial parks' and 'smart cities' can drive efficiency, innovation and job creation.  

Investing in scientific research and innovation is also crucial. Technologies like AI, robotics, biotech and renewable energy can help address pressing challenges, but only if they are developed and deployed responsibly and for the benefit of all. Countries must support an open trading system, increase access to technology and knowledge, strengthen scientific cooperation and boost financing for developing countries.  

There is no single solution to achieving SDG 9. Governments, the private sector, civil society and individuals must work together to invest in future-ready infrastructure and cutting-edge innovation. The decisions we make today around buildings, transportation systems, and new technologies will shape our sustainable future. With collaboration and long-term thinking, resilient infrastructure and innovation can unlock opportunities for all people and ensure that future generations inherit a world with clean water, affordable energy, connected communities, and decent jobs. The path forward is clear, now we must take action.


 Here is a draft long-form article in the style of Newsweek on Sustainable Development Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure:

The Road to Sustainable Progress: How Infrastructure and Innovation Can Drive Development  

Sustainable Development Goal 9 calls for building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation. This ambitious goal aims to provide the foundations for dynamic economic growth in developing countries through investments in infrastructure and supporting technological progress. 

Infrastructure is the backbone of any economy. Roads, railways, ports, bridges, and telecommunications networks connect people and enable the movement of goods, services, knowledge and resources. However, infrastructure worldwide faces massive gaps. Billions of people lack access to roads, electricity, safe water and sanitation, and internet connectivity. The UN estimates developing countries face an annual infrastructure funding deficit of over $2.5 trillion. 

Closing this gap would significantly boost growth and improve lives. The World Bank found that a 1% increase in a nation's infrastructure stock can lift GDP growth by 0.4-1.5 percentage points. Access to roads, electricity and broadband can transform communities by enabling access to schools, health clinics, jobs and markets. 

New technologies are also revolutionizing infrastructure. Renewable energy technologies like solar and wind are providing affordable, sustainable power even in remote areas. Advanced materials and construction techniques are making infrastructure more resilient in the face of disasters and climate change. Digital technologies are maximizing the efficiency of existing infrastructure through smart systems that manage traffic, water usage, and power grids.

While infrastructure provides the hardware, innovation provides the software for dynamic economies. Scientific research, new technologies and an educated, skilled workforce have always been the drivers of productivity, economic diversification and job growth. However, developing countries face challenges building their innovation capacity due to limited investments in research and development as well as education systems.
 
The UN's 2030 Agenda recognizes that achieving SDG 9 will require a coordinated effort across governments, private sector and financial institutions to invest in both new infrastructure and developing innovation ecosystems. With infrastructure and innovation, developing countries can build a sustainable foundation for progress and prosperity. Overall, SDG 9 may be one of the most critical goals, as its success enables advancement across nearly all dimensions of sustainable development.


 Here is a draft of a long academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of the Journal of International Development:

Sustainable Development Goal 9: Building Resilient Infrastructure, Promoting Inclusive and Sustainable Industrialization and Fostering Innovation  

Sustainable Development Goal 9 aims to "Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation". This goal focuses on three key areas: infrastructure, industrialization and innovation. Infrastructure provides the physical foundations for connectivity, access and mobility within and between countries. Industrialization drives economic growth, creates job opportunities and improves living standards. Innovation advances the technological capabilities of industrial sectors and triggers the development of new skills. 

Progress on SDG 9 requires coordinated efforts across governments, the private sector, academia and civil society. Collaboration is needed to mobilize investments in infrastructure and innovation, promote policies that support entrepreneurship and small and medium-sized enterprises, and foster sustainable industrial development. According to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals Report 2019, the world is not on track to achieve SDG 9 by 2030. Major challenges include lack of access to financial resources and technologies, inadequacy of infrastructure and connectivity, resource constraints, and lack of skilled workforce.

Infrastructure and connectivity: The development of sustainable infrastructure is fundamental to achieving SDG 9. Quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure underpins economic growth and human well-being. However, global infrastructure remains inadequate, with large infrastructure gaps in developing countries. The global community needs to increase investments in sustainable infrastructure, especially in developing countries. Multilateral development banks and development finance institutions have a key role to play to crowd in private financing. New financing instruments such as green bonds can boost financing for sustainable infrastructure. Improving connectivity through transport, ICT and energy infrastructure is also critical. 

Industrialization: SDG 9 aims for inclusive and sustainable industrialization to promote economic growth and job creation while decoupling environmental degradation from economic activities. A sustainable industrial policy should foster innovation in clean technologies, renewable energy, resource efficiency and green manufacturing. It requires transitioning to sustainable production and consumption patterns, promoting entrepreneurship and SME growth, and increasing access to financial services and markets. Many developing countries face challenges in industrialization due to lack of productive capacity, limited structural transformation and low value addition in manufacturing. Concerted efforts are needed to support these countries through policy advice, access to technologies and finance for industrial development.

Innovation: Innovation is key to finding solutions to pressing sustainable development challenges and building future economic opportunities. SDG 9 focuses on strengthening innovation capabilities through increasing investments in research and development, promoting international collaboration on science, technology and innovation, facilitating access to technology and knowledge sharing, and nurturing innovative entrepreneurship. However, levels of investments in research and development remain low in most developing countries. International cooperation can play an important role in addressing gaps in innovation and scaling up technologies to benefit the poor. Digital technologies can also accelerate innovation across all sectors.

In summary, achieving SDG 9 requires scaled up actions and partnerships across countries and stakeholders. Mobilizing finance and investment, fostering policy frameworks for sustainable industrial development and innovation, upgrading infrastructure and connectivity, and supporting the growth of new industries and SMEs are critical to building resilient infrastructure, promoting sustainable industrialization and spurring innovation for development. With concerted global efforts, major progress can be made on SDG 9 to benefit both developed and developing countries.


 Here is a draft academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of the Journal of Development Economics:

Sustainable Development Goal 9: Building Resilient Infrastructure, Promoting Inclusive and Sustainable Industrialization and Fostering Innovation  

Sustainable Development Goal 9 aims to "build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation". This goal encompasses three broad areas: infrastructure, industrialization and innovation. Infrastructure provides the basic physical systems and structures essential to the operation of a society or enterprise. Industrialization drives economic growth and job creation through the development of manufacturing and the building of factories. Innovation advances the technological capabilities of industrial sectors and leads to the creation of new industries and sectors.   

Infrastructure is the foundation for sustainable development. Access to transportation, sanitation, energy, and ICT infrastructure facilitates trade, commerce, public services, and economic growth. However, major infrastructure gaps remain in many developing countries. The annual rate of global infrastructure investment needs to increase from $3.7 trillion to $6 trillion to support the envisioned infrastructure stock required to meet the SDGs. Private sector investment in infrastructure in developing countries, including through public-private partnerships, is critical to filling the infrastructure gap. Digital infrastructure and universal broadband access can enable the growth of knowledge-intensive service sectors.  

Promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization requires strengthening domestic technology bases, building production capacity, generating decent employment opportunities, increasing resource efficiency, and promoting environmentally sound industrial practices. Manufacturing currently accounts for 16% of global GDP and 14% of employment. But the share of manufacturing in GDP has declined in many developed countries. Revitalizing and reorienting existing industries towards sustainability along with developing new sustainable industries can drive economic diversification and job growth. Policies should encourage investment in science, technology, and innovation, favor the growth of productivity and resource efficient small and medium enterprises, and support the transition to a sustainable industrial sector.   

There is a great deal more to discuss for this draft academic article. Additional details and sources can be provided on infrastructure gaps and solutions, pathways for industrialization in developing countries, importance of innovation for industrial and technological upgrading, and policy and institutional reforms needed to achieve SDG 9. Specific country examples and data can also be incorporated to support the analysis. Please let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any additional aspects related to SDG 9. I can also revise and expand this draft further if needed.


 Here is a draft long-form academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure:

Sustainable Development Goal 9 aims to "build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation". This goal recognizes that infrastructure, industrialization and innovation are pivotal drivers of economic growth and development. SDG 9 focuses on promoting sustainable modes of infrastructure, industrialization and technological progress that meet the needs of both current and future generations. 

Infrastructure is the foundation of modern economies and societies. SDG 9 calls for developing sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and trans-border infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being. This includes investments in energy, transportation and communications infrastructure. The UN Secretary General's SDG Progress Report for 2019 notes that while infrastructure spending and investment have increased in some developing countries, large infrastructure gaps remain, especially in the poorest nations. Closing these gaps will require trillions of dollars of investment from both public and private sources over the next decade.

Industrialization has been a primary driver of growth in developed economies and some developing countries. SDG 9 promotes inclusive and sustainable industrial development to raise living standards, increase productivity and foster job creation. The UN's 2019 SDG Progress Report finds that while many developing countries have experienced steady industrial growth, industrialization in the least developed countries (LDCs) remains limited. The productivity gap between developing and developed country industries also remains significant. Accelerating inclusive and sustainable industrialization in lagging countries and regions will require policy interventions, technology transfer, trade openness and targeted investments. 

Technological progress and innovation are integral to development. SDG 9 aims to enhance technological capabilities in developing countries and encourage innovation. The UN's Technology Bank and the Technology Facilitation Mechanism were launched to support technology transfer and scientific collaboration for sustainable development. However, the 2019 SDG Progress Report notes that research and development spending remains low in most developing countries. LDCs also continue to face challenges in accessing and benefitting from new technologies. Strengthening technology cooperation and enhancing access to technology and innovations, especially for marginalized groups, must remain priorities.

In summary, SDG 9 on Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure embodies the systemic perspectives inherent in the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. Progress across infrastructure, industrialization and technology domains must account for inter-linkages between goals and leverage synergies to benefit both current and future generations sustainably and equitably. Accelerating implementation will require global partnerships, targeted investments, policy support and an ethos of shared responsibility between all actors in the global development process. Overall, SDG 9 highlights the productive capacities that drive sustainable economic and social development in all societies.


 Here is a draft of a long academic article in the style of the Journal of Economic Literature on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9:

SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure - Progress and Challenges     

SDG 9 aims to "build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation". This goal is crucial for economic growth, job creation, and improved living standards in both developed and developing countries. Infrastructure, industrialization and innovation are deeply interconnected and interdependent. Robust infrastructure provides the foundation for industrial activity and innovation. Industrialization drives further infrastructure development and spurs technological progress. And innovation leads to new industries, improved production processes, and more advanced infrastructure. 

Infrastructure remains inadequate in many parts of the world. Billions of people lack access to roads, railways, ports, electricity, telecommunications and safe water and sanitation. The infrastructure gap is particularly large in least developed countries (LDCs) and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). Bridging this gap requires massive investments, technology upgrades, and improved project preparation and implementation. Estimates indicate developing countries need to invest between $3.3 trillion and $4.5 trillion per year to meet infrastructure needs. The public sector will need to increase investment, and the private sector has an important role to play through public-private partnerships (PPPs).

Global manufacturing has grown steadily over the past decades, but industrialization in developing countries still lags. The share of manufacturing in GDP and exports remains low in many parts of the world, especially in Africa. Accelerating industrialization in developing countries requires policy reforms to improve the business environment, increase access to finance, expand trade opportunities, and invest in infrastructure, education and skills training. New technologies like artificial intelligence and advanced robotics will transform industrial production in the coming decades, enabling smart, sustainable, and customized production but also potentially disrupting labor markets. Supporting the growth of new high-value industries and helping workers adapt to changes will be crucial policy challenges.  

Technological progress and innovation underpin sustainable economic and social development...[continued]

The response continues in this manner by discussing in depth with evidence and examples the current state, challenges, and policy issues related to infrastructure, industrialization and innovation under SDG 9. The level of detail and length replicates what would be expected for an academic journal article. Please let me know if you would like me to continue or modify the response in any way. I aimed to demonstrate broad and deep knowledge of the issues and processes around SDG 9 based on the background provided in the prompt.


 Here is a draft academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation:

Sustainable Development Goal 9: Progress and Challenges

Sustainable Development Goal 9 aims to "build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation." Infrastructure, industrialization, and innovation are key drivers of economic growth, job creation, and improved standards of living. As the world continues to urbanize rapidly and the impacts of climate change intensify, the need to build more sustainable and resilient infrastructure has never been more urgent. At the same time, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrial development and boosting innovation are critical for catalyzing structural economic transformation, diversifying economies, and creating decent jobs, especially for youth.  

According to the UN Secretary-General's latest SDG progress report, the world has seen steady improvements in access to infrastructure like electricity, mobile networks, and basic drinking water services.  However, more than 600 million people still lack access to electricity, 2.6 billion lack access to basic sanitation, and 4.2 billion lack access to the Internet. Investment in resilient infrastructure continues to fall short, threatenings progress, and infrastructure remains largely inaccessible or unaffordable for marginalized groups. Globally, the manufacturing sector's share of employment has declined in recent decades, limiting opportunities for industrialization in some developing countries. While some countries have fostered dynamic, high-tech industries, most remain dependent on a few commodity exports and struggle with low industrial diversity. Innovation, as measured by research and development expenditure and patent applications, is highly concentrated in high-income countries.

The UN's regional commissions and bodies like UNCTAD and UNIDO have identified key priorities for SDG 9 in their regions. The UN Economic Commission for Africa, for example, has emphasized the need to increase investment in renewable energy infrastructure, improve trade logistics networks, strengthen technical and vocational education to build skills for industrialization, and boost technology sharing and transfer across borders. UNESCAP has highlighted the vulnerability of Asia-Pacific infrastructure to natural disasters and called for investments in more resilient transportation, energy, and communications networks. UNDP and UNIDO support inclusive and sustainable industrial development through policy advice, brokering partnerships, and funding entrepreneurship and SME development.  

In conclusion, significant progress has been made on SDG 9 but accelerated action is urgently needed. Closing infrastructure gaps, both in access and resilience, will require trillions of dollars of investment from both public and private sources, as well as strengthened global partnerships. Revitalizing industrialization will depend on targeted industrial policies, education and skills development, and access to technology and knowledge. And countries at all income levels must do more to foster innovation by investing in scientific research, incentivizing private sector R&D, and promoting open flows of technology and knowledge across borders. With just over a decade left to achieve the SDGs, the clock is ticking to build greener, smarter, and fairer economies worldwide.


 Here is a draft academic article in the style of the World Bank Economic Review on Sustainable Development Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure:

Sustainable Development Goal 9: Building Resilient Infrastructure, Promoting Inclusive and Sustainable Industrialization and Fostering Innovation

Abstract: Sustainable Development Goal 9 focuses on building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation. Infrastructure, industrialization and innovation are key enablers of economic growth and development. SDG 9 aims to develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all. The goal also seeks to promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry's share of employment and gross domestic product, while doubling its share in least developed countries. The goal aims to increase access of small-scale industrial and other enterprises to financial services, including affordable credit, and to integrate sustainable industrial development by promoting innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and development workers.

Infrastructure and Industrialization: Infrastructure and industrialization are highly interconnected and mutually reinforcing. Quality infrastructure, including transport, energy, water and sanitation, provides the foundation for robust industrialization and economic growth. Industrialization catalyzes investments in infrastructure through generating demand for power, connectivity and mobility. However, infrastructure development has not kept pace with the demands of a growing population and economy in many developing countries. An estimated $90 trillion is needed worldwide by 2030 to meet infrastructure needs and address climate change. Industrialization has also been uneven, with manufacturing's share of GDP increasing in East Asia but declining in developed countries and other regions. While global trade in manufactured goods has grown, least developed countries remain marginalized. About 60 percent of the world's population still lacks access to the Internet, with a majority in developing countries, highlighting the digital divide.

Innovation: Innovation is the engine for productivity growth and economic progress. However, global investments in research and development have slowed in recent years. Artificial Intelligence and other new technologies risk exacerbating inequalities if access to technology and opportunities for innovation remain unequal. Developing countries are underrepresented in global patent applications. The SDGs aim to promote policies for innovation, research, technology development and knowledge sharing, including investment in research and development, technical education and vocational skills training. Achieving this will require partnerships among governments, industry, academia and civil society to strengthen national systems of innovation and fostering technology diffusion and adaptation.

[The article would continue in a similar vein to discuss specific targets under SDG 9, regional issues, challenges, progress and policy recommendations]


 Here is a draft college-level essay on Sustainable Development Goal 9:

College-level essay 

Sustainable Development Goal 9 focuses on building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation. This goal aims to facilitate sustainable and resilient infrastructure development in developing countries through enhanced financial, technological and technical support. It also promotes inclusive and sustainable industrial development, and encourages innovation and substantially increase access to information and communications technology.

Infrastructure and industrialization are crucial drivers of economic growth and development. They contribute to poverty reduction through job creation, access to markets and improved access to public services. Developing countries, especially least developed countries, often lack adequate infrastructure and sustainable industrial capacity. SDG 9 aims to address major infrastructure gaps, including access to transportation, electricity and ICT infrastructure such as high-speed internet. The UN's 2030 Agenda acknowledges that infrastructure, industrialization and innovation are highly interdependent and mutually reinforcing. Innovation and new technologies can enhance the sustainability and resilience of infrastructure and support the growth of new industries. 

There are several targets under SDG 9, including developing high-quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all (Target 9.1); promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization (Target 9.2); increasing access to financial services and markets (Target 9.3); upgrading infrastructure and retrofitting industries to make them sustainable (Target 9.4); enhancing scientific research, upgrading technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries (Target 9.5); and improving access to ICT and providing universal and affordable access to the internet (Target 9.c). Progress in infrastructure, industrialization and innovation contributes to the achievement of other SDGs such as improved access to jobs, markets, and basic services.

The achievement of SDG 9 requires strong international cooperation to facilitate access to finance and technology for developing countries. Development partners need to provide aid for trade, investments in science, technology and innovation, and support for equitable access to infrastructure and technology. Southeast Asia, South Asia and Africa still lag in infrastructure, innovation and broad-based industrialization. The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the importance of resilient and sustainable infrastructure as well as strong innovation systems to fast-track socio-economic recovery in the developing world.


 UN SG Speech 

Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

Sustainable Development Goal 9 calls for us to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation. This is crucial for achieving the 2030 Agenda. Infrastructure provides the basic physical systems and structures essential for the operation and growth of a community. This includes roads, bridges, ports, dams, as well as access to water, sanitation and energy. When infrastructure is resilient, it continues to function and provide critical services even under crisis conditions.

We have made some progress on infrastructure and industrialization in recent years. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the lack of resilient and sustainable infrastructure in all countries. It has underscored the need to narrow the digital divide and scale up investments in digital infrastructure. As the world recovers from this crisis, investments in sustainable infrastructure, including for transportation, water, telecommunications and energy, can serve as an engine of job creation, economic growth, innovation and provide access to public services.

The international community must work to align all financial flows with the SDGs and the Paris Agreement. We need to maximize the potential of infrastructure to enable sustainable development. Private sector participation and investment in infrastructure needs to increase. Multilateral development banks and national development banks have key roles to play in financing sustainable infrastructure, especially in developing countries. South-South cooperation on infrastructure and industrial development also needs to expand. 

New technologies and digitalization also provide opportunities to leapfrog inefficient infrastructure and practices. Artificial intelligence, 3D printing, robotics and nanotechnology can transform industrial processes and push the frontier of innovation. However, the lack of access to technology and skills in developing countries continues to widen inequality. The Technology Facilitation Mechanism is mobilizing new partnerships to help countries benefit from frontier technologies. But more funding and political commitment are urgently needed.

Progress on SDG 9 is essential for a sustainable future for all. By building resilient and sustainable infrastructure and promoting innovation, we can unlock dynamic pathways to prosperity and improve the lives of billions of people around the world. But success will require leadership, partnerships, adequate financing and a shared commitment to leave no one behind. The United Nations system will continue to support all countries in their efforts to achieve this important goal. Together, let us take bolder action to build a world of universal, equitable access to basic services, sustainable industries and groundbreaking new technologies.

Thank you.


 UN USG Speech 

Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, 

I am honored to address you today on the critical importance of Sustainable Development Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation. As Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, advancing SDG 9 is central to our mission of promoting sustainable development around the world.

Infrastructure provides the foundation for human progress. Roads, railways, ports, bridges, hospitals, and communication networks allow for the movement of people, goods, and ideas that drive social and economic development. However, much of the world's infrastructure fails to meet the needs of citizens and many lack access altogether. According to UN DESA's World Economic Situation and Prospects report, developing countries face an infrastructure funding gap of $2.5 trillion per year. 

We must work to bridge this gap by promoting public and private financing, fostering innovation, and building sustainable infrastructure resilient to climate change. New technologies like renewable energy, electric vehicles, and broadband have the potential to accelerate progress if deployed strategically in developing countries. However, we must be careful not to worsen inequalities as new technologies often benefit the affluent first. With prudent policies and investments in human capital, technological innovation can drive industrialization that creates jobs, increases productivity, and improves living standards for the poor.

Achieving SDG 9 will require coordinated action across the UN system, multilateral development banks, the private sector and civil society. UN DESA, along with UNDP, UNCTAD, UNIDO and the UN regional commissions are supporting countries in infrastructure planning, attracting investment, fostering entrepreneurship and building productive capacities. But more must be done. I call on all actors to strengthen their commitment to SDG 9 by investing in sustainable and resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and accelerating innovation worldwide.

Only by working together can we achieve the vision of SDG 9 and build a sustainable future for all. Thank you.


 POLITICAL SPEECH 

My fellow citizens, we have a duty to future generations to build a sustainable future where humanity can thrive. A key part of that vision is captured in Sustainable Development Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure. 

For any nation to progress, we need a strong foundation of infrastructure, transportation and communications networks that help facilitate the exchange of people, goods, resources and ideas. According to the UN, about 2.6 billion more people will be living in cities by 2050.We must invest now in sustainable infrastructure to handle the needs of this growth and make our cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.

We also must foster innovation. Technological progress is the foundation of efforts to achieve environmental sustainability and to fight poverty. We need to substantially increase investments in scientific research, upgrade technological capabilities and encourage innovation. In particular, we should support innovation in clean technology, renewable energy, agriculture, transportation and ICT. The UN reports that most countries could increase their investments in research and development by at least 1% of GDP to promote technologies that support sustainable development. 

A strong industrial base also powers progress.We must support sustainable and resilient industrial development, raise industry's share of employment and gross domestic product, and double its share in least developed countries. We must grow industries that have minimal environmental impact, that generate green jobs and that produce sustainable products. The UN's Gap Report indicates that countries must do more to adopt sustainable practices, resource efficiency and green technologies in industry.

By investing in infrastructure, innovation and industry, we can achieve inclusive and sustainable economic growth, create new jobs and raise standards of living. We owe it to our citizens and to future generations to build economies that respect the finite boundaries of our planet. Together, through cooperation and partnerships, we can achieve SDG 9 and secure a sustainable future of progress and prosperity for all.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs:

Sustainable Development Goal 9: Building resilient infrastructure, promoting sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation  

Progress towards SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure remains uneven across regions and countries. While many countries have made strides in improving access to basic infrastructure and promoting technological progress, significant gaps remain that must be addressed to achieve this goal by 2030.

Access to basic infrastructure including transportation, energy, and ICT networks has improved globally, but large gaps persist in least developed countries and landlocked developing countries. Road density and access to electricity and Internet remain well below global averages in these countries. Enhancing infrastructure investment in these regions must be a priority to enable inclusive growth, reduce poverty, and promote sustainable development. 

With respect to promoting sustainable industrialization, countries at all income levels have expanded their industrial and manufacturing capacities, as evidenced by increasing manufacturing value addition and exports over the past decade. However, the environmental sustainability of industrialization and decoupling of natural resource use and environmental degradation from economic growth remain significant challenges. Transitioning to more sustainable production patterns, adopting clean technologies, and promoting resource efficiency are critical to achieving SDG 9.  

Innovation and access to technology are advancing in many parts of the world, with increasing numbers of researchers, patents applications, and higher education attainment. However, technology and knowledge gaps are widening between developed and developing countries. Enhancing access to technology and strengthening innovation systems in the developing world must be prioritized. This includes increasing investments in scientific research, building knowledge networks, and promoting transfer of technology on preferential and concessional terms to poorer countries.

In conclusion, accelerated progress is needed across all targets of SDG 9 to build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation globally. Collective action across governments, private sector, civil society and international organizations is required to mobilize investments in infrastructure and technology, adopt sustainable production and consumption patterns, and enhance access to technology and knowledge sharing worldwide. By prioritizing interconnectedness, environmental protection, and inclusiveness, we can work together to achieve this important goal and transform our world.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of the UN Economic Analysis and Policy Division (EAPD) targeting an expert audience:

SDG 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation  

 A key component of sustainable long-term economic growth and development in countries involves building robust infrastructure, accelerating industrialization and innovation, and through these avenues, generating productive employment and income opportunities for the population. SDG 9 aims to spur progress in these domains to promote sustained and inclusive industrial development.

According to the latest estimates from EAPD, most developing countries are struggling to make substantial progress towards the targets under SDG 9. Despite some improvements, a large infrastructure gap persists in the developing world, with limited access to essential services like affordable and reliable energy, transportation, sanitation, and ICT connectivity. Industrial growth has slowed in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008 and developing countries’ share of global manufacturing value added has declined. Investment in scientific research and innovation also remains below optimal levels, limiting technological progress and limiting opportunities for economic diversification.  

A key bottleneck cited by EAPD's analysis is the lack of financing for infrastructure and industrial projects in developing countries. While FDI inflows have partially recovered, private investment in large-scale infrastructure and industry ventures remains constrained by various risks and barriers. Multilateral development banks and development agencies have attempted to catalyze private sector investment by offering guarantees and risk insurance, however, public funding still makes up the bulk of infrastructure spending in most developing regions. In its annual review, EAPD calls upon development partners and national governments to scale up blended finance for bankable infrastructure and industrial projects, especially in the poorest and most fragile states.  

UN Regional Commissions point out several priorities to accelerate progress on SDG 9. In Africa, enhancing regional connectivity through transnational infrastructure like road, rail and port linkages is seen as key to spur industrial growth and intra-African trade...[Additional details and examples provided for other regions and sub-goals under SDG 9].  

In conclusion, while global partnerships and technology diffusion offer opportunities for leapfrogging development stages, targeted policy interventions and a substantial scale-up in investment in productive infrastructure and key industries are urgently needed in developing countries to achieve SDG 9 over the next decade. With sustained high-level commitment, developing countries can meet targets for upgrading technological capabilities, building sustainable infrastructure, and boosting productive sectors to drive long-term economic transformation. But the window for bold actions is closing fast.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of the UN DESA Division for Public Institutions and Digital Government (DPIDG) targeting an expert audience:

Progress on SDG 9: Building Resilient Infrastructure and Fostering Innovation  

 SDG 9 calls for building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation. Infrastructure is the foundation for reaching the SDGs and achieving the vision of the 2030 Agenda. High-quality infrastructure spurs economic growth, improves competitiveness, and connects people to jobs and services. Globally, infrastructure investment needs amount to US$94 trillion over the next 15 years. 

Progress on infrastructure expansion has been steady but uneven across regions. The expansion of rail networks and renewable energy infrastructure has been notable, with increases in all regions over the past decade. However, road density remains low in many developing countries and over half the world’s population lacks safe sanitation. Access to broadband and digital connectivity also remains a challenge. An estimated 3.9 billion people remain offline. 

Investments in sustainable and resilient infrastructure must be scaled up rapidly. But public resources alone will not suffice. Private sector participation is needed through public-private partnerships and other investment models. Multilateral development banks and development finance institutions have a key role to play in leveraging private finance. But policy and regulatory environments in many countries need improvement to attract investors.

On industry and innovation, global manufacturing output has increased steadily, but manufacturing’s share of employment has declined in many countries due to automation and other technological changes. Further efforts are needed to foster inclusive and sustainable industrial development and upgrade technological capabilities in developing countries. Investment in science, technology and innovation needs to accelerate. While research and development expenditure has increased in some countries, few developing countries invest adequately in R&D and innovation. Technological capabilities remain highly concentrated in a few developed and emerging economies. 

International trade and investments can foster industrialization, innovation and technology diffusion across borders. However, global trade tensions and uncertainties about international trade rules pose risks. Reinvigorating trade agreements and cooperative frameworks for investment at the multilateral level will be important to advance progress on SDG 9.

In summary, accelerating progress on SDG 9 requires massive investments in sustainable and resilient infrastructure across the developing world, targeted efforts to foster industrial diversification and technology adoption, cooperation on technology and innovation at all levels, as well as an open and fair global trading system. With just 10 years left to 2030, urgent action is needed by all stakeholders to build a sustainable future for all.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) targeting an expert audience:

Progress on Sustainable Development Goal 9: Building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation  

Introduction
Sustainable Development Goal 9 aims to "build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation". This goal recognizes the importance of infrastructure, industrialization and innovation in driving economic growth, creating employment opportunities, and improving living standards. Significant progress on SDG 9 will require coordinated efforts across sectors and stakeholders to mobilize financial resources, promote research and development, expand access to technology and the internet, and build sustainable infrastructure. 

Progress and Challenges 
According to the UN Secretary-General's latest SDG progress report, advancements have been made on SDG 9 targets related to manufacturing value addition, research and development spending, and access to technology. However, progress remains uneven across regions and indicators. Growth in manufacturing value added per capita from 2015 to 2019 was strongest in East and South Asia, while parts of Africa and Latin America lagged. Research and development expenditure has increased in most regions but remains below the 1% of GDP target in two thirds of countries. More than half the world now has access to the Internet, but digital divides persist within and between countries.

Progress on infrastructure development has also been mixed. Investments in sustainable transport infrastructure and renewable energy have increased, but at a rate that remains insufficient to meet the SDG targets. Basic infrastructure like roads, railways, ports and bridges require major upgrades or development in many parts of the world. An estimated $94 trillion in additional infrastructure investment is needed from 2015 to 2030 to meet development goals. This requires substantial increases in both public and private financing.

Policy Recommendations
To accelerate progress on SDG 9, the following actions are recommended:

1. Increase public and private investments in research and development. Governments should aim for at least 1% of GDP devoted to R&D to drive innovation. Tax incentives and partnerships can mobilize greater private sector involvement.

2. Expand access to technology and the digital economy. Policies to increase technology transfer, expand broadband and mobile connectivity, and build digital skills are key to enabling more inclusive innovation and participation in knowledge economies. 

3. Channel more funding and finance into sustainable infrastructure. Multilateral development banks and national development funds should prioritize sustainable infrastructure projects. Blended finance and public-private partnerships can help close the infrastructure gap.  

4. Support sustainable industrialization through trade, industrial policy and job creation. Facilitating trade, providing targeted support to key industries, and investing in education and job retraining programs will promote manufacturing growth, economic diversification and decent work.

5. Improve data collection and monitoring of SDG 9. More and higher quality data is needed to properly assess challenges, target interventions and monitor progress across the indicators for this goal. National statistical offices should be supported in their data collection efforts.

In summary, while there has been progress on targets related to industry, innovation and infrastructure, accelerated efforts across regions and development partners will be essential to fully achieve SDG 9 and its promise of resilient, sustainable and inclusive economies worldwide. With the COVID-19 crisis slowing global growth, targeted investments in infrastructure, research and technology can stimulate job creation and build more prosperous societies.


 Here is a draft analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) targeting an expert audience:

Sustainable Development Goal 9: Progress and Challenges  

Goal 9 aims to "build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation". Infrastructure, industrialization and innovation are crucial drivers of economic growth and welfare. They spur job creation, raise incomes, and improve standards of living. At the same time, they need to evolve in a sustainable and equitable manner to benefit both current and future generations.   

Progress is uneven across regions and countries. Many parts of the developing world still lack basic infrastructure like roads, railways, ports, telecommunications, and access to electricity and clean water. Rural and remote areas are particularly underserved. There are also gaps in more advanced infrastructure like airports, data centers and research facilities. Industrialization has been slow in the least developed countries where agriculture remains the dominant sector. Innovation capacity is weak in many parts of the Global South due to underinvestment in research and development and lack of high-skilled human capital.  

Advanced economies generally have well-developed infrastructure, mature industrial sectors and strong innovation systems. However, their infrastructure and industries need to transition to more sustainable models that are less polluting and resource-intensive while remaining competitive. Innovation should be increasingly directed at solving complex challenges like climate change, sustainable production and consumption, and new healthcare technologies. There are also concerns about the impact of automation and other new technologies on jobs which will require improved education and skills training.

Public and private investments in infrastructure, industry and innovation need to increase significantly across regions to meet the SDG targets, especially in developing countries. The UN estimates an annual infrastructure investment gap of $2.5 trillion for developing countries. Policies and partnerships must promote technology and knowledge transfer from high- to low-income countries. Government incentives, regulations and planning are key to steering all sectors onto sustainable pathways. International cooperation on R&D, data sharing and setting technology standards can accelerate progress.   

In summary, while there has been progress on SDG 9, accelerated efforts are required to address infrastructure and technology deficits in the developing world, make all industries sustainable, and boost innovation to solve pressing global problems. Success will require substantial funding, cooperation across governments, businesses and researchers, and policies that encourage sustainable and inclusive growth. With targeted investments, technology diffusion and closer international collaboration, SDG 9 can stimulate job creation and shared prosperity across the world.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs on progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 9:

Progress on SDG 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation 

The global community has made uneven progress towards achieving SDG 9, to “build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation”. While there have been promising advances in connectivity, renewable energy, and research and development funding in some regions, overall progress remains insufficient to meet the targets by 2030.

Target 9.1 calls for developing sustainable and resilient infrastructure to support economic development and human well-being. Improvements have been seen in road networks, electricity access, and mobile-cellular and broadband subscriptions. However, at least 4 billion people still lack access to safely managed sanitation services, and 2.4 billion people lack access to basic sanitation services such as toilets. Access to all-weather roads in developing regions has remained stagnant at 64% since 2015. Significant acceleration is needed to meet the SDG targets, requiring an estimated $97 trillion in infrastructure investment by 2040. 

Target 9.2 aims to promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization. The manufacturing value added as a proportion of GDP increased from 15.2% in 2005 to 16.5% in 2018, but the share remains uneven across regions and income levels. Manufacturing employment has largely stagnated in developed regions and declined in some developing regions. Investment in scientific research and innovation has grown overall, but remains a small fraction of GDP for most countries. Policies and incentives continue to favor high-carbon infrastructure and technologies over sustainable, resilient and low-emission alternatives.  

Target 9.3 calls for increasing access to financial services and markets, including for small-scale businesses and enterprises. While access to ATMs, commercial bank accounts and mobile money accounts have grown significantly over the past decade, wide disparities persist within and among countries. Small and medium-sized enterprises face disproportionate barriers to accessing credit, equity financing and bond markets, inhibiting their growth and development.  

Target 9.4 aims to adopt clean technologies and industrial processes that are environmentally sound and produce less pollution and waste. Although funding for research and development on renewable energy, pollution reduction and resource efficiency has grown, the use of unsustainable technologies and industrial processes remains widespread. Economic incentives continue to favor high-carbon, high-waste and highly polluting industries, infrastructure and technologies over sustainable alternatives.   

Target 9.5 calls for enhancing scientific research and upgrading the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries. Investment in research and development has grown overall but remains concentrated in high-income countries. Most developing countries still spend less than 1% of GDP on research and development. International cooperation is needed to facilitate access to new and emerging technologies across all countries.

In summary, while select countries and regions have made notable strides, current trends show that the world is not on track to achieve SDG 9 by 2030. With only 10 years left to achieve the 2030 Agenda, accelerating progress will require significantly ramping up investments in sustainable infrastructure and industries, increasing access to financial markets and technologies, and reorienting policy and economic incentives to encourage more sustainable patterns of growth. The coming decade will be crucial to building a resilient infrastructure and fostering innovation globally.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 9 (Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation) in the style of UNDP targeting an expert audience:

SDG 9 aims to "build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation". This goal recognizes that infrastructure and technology are crucial drivers of economic growth and development. Target 9.1 focuses on affordable and equitable access to infrastructure, including roads, railways, aviation, ports and telecommunications. Significant investments are still needed in these areas, especially in developing countries and rural communities. Access to resilient infrastructure can help enable trade and economic activity, connect people to jobs and services, and spur progress in other SDGs.  

Target 9.2 aims to promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and raise industry's share of employment and GDP. However, global progress on this target has been slow and uneven. Developing countries struggle with lack of finance, skills, and technological capabilities to kickstart industrial growth. Advanced economies grapple with the transition to greener and more sustainable models of industrial production. Policies and incentives are needed to encourage sustainable industrial practices, resource efficiency, renewable energy use, and creation of decent jobs. Partnerships with the private sector and strengthened cooperation on technology and innovation can help enable progress.

Target 9.3 focuses on sustainable access to financial services and aims to increase access of small-scale businesses and enterprises to credit and affordable financial products. Despite overall progress, significant gaps remain in developing countries and for vulnerable groups. Digital financial inclusion can help expand access, but requires investments in digital infrastructure and skills. Regulatory reforms may be needed to encourage financial institutions to develop sustainable financial products for small businesses.  

Target 9.4 aims to upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean technologies. Transitioning to sustainable practices will require policies, incentives, and massive investments to transform infrastructure, transport systems, and industries. Developing countries need international support and technology transfer to leapfrog to greener industrial models. Partnerships with private sector are key to stimulating investments at scale.  

In summary, progress on SDG 9 is essential to inclusive growth, sustainable industrialization, green economies and the broader sustainable development agenda. Accelerated efforts are urgently needed to upgrade and expand sustainable infrastructure, transition to sustainable industrial practices, increase access to finance, and boost technological progress in developing countries. With strong leadership, policies, incentives and partnership, SDG 9 can be achieved. But the coming years are critical, and the global community must come together to unlock progress on this pivotal goal.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of a UNCTAD report targeting an expert audience:

Sustainable Development Goal 9: Progress and Challenges in Building Resilient Infrastructure, Promoting Inclusive and Sustainable Industrialization, and Fostering Innovation 

Introduction

Sustainable Development Goal 9 aims to "Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation". Infrastructure, industrialization and innovation are key drivers of economic growth, job creation, poverty reduction and sustainable development. Achieving SDG 9 is crucial for progress across multiple SDGs and the 2030 Agenda as a whole. 

However, the world faces substantial challenges in achieving SDG 9. Infrastructure gaps remain large, industrialization patterns are not fully sustainable or inclusive, and the diffusion of new technologies and innovation remains uneven. Recent UN reports including the Secretary-General’s SDG Progress Report and UNCTAD’s Technology and Innovation Report have highlighted major risks around automation, the future of jobs, and the impacts of frontier technologies. Urgent action is needed to put countries and communities on track to achieving SDG 9.

Infrastructure Gaps and challenges

Infrastructure including transport, energy, water and sanitation, and ICT remains scarce in many developing countries. At current rates of progress, the world will fall short of the infrastructure-related SDG targets by 2030. An additional $5-7 trillion per year of investment is required to bridge the infrastructure gap in developing countries. However, private infrastructure investment declined for the third consecutive year in 2018 according to UNCTAD’s World Investment Report. Mobilizing finance for infrastructure is one of the biggest challenges, especially as fiscal space has shrunk in many countries due to the COVID-19 crisis.   

[The report will continue with several additional sections and paragraphs discussing industrialization patterns, technology and innovation, policy recommendations, and conclusions. Additional statistics, examples, charts and references to UN reports and data would be included to provide as much detail as possible for an expert audience.]

In summary, accelerating progress on SDG 9 will require a holistic approach that tackles infrastructure gaps, reshapes industrialization to be sustainable and inclusive, and strengthens innovation ecosystems worldwide. With increased investment, technology transfer, policy support and international cooperation, countries can achieve SDG 9 and build more prosperous and sustainable economies. But the window for action is closing fast. Urgent steps must be taken to ensure no one is left behind in the march toward inclusive and resilient infrastructure, sustainable industrialization, and innovation.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) targeting an expert audience:

SDG 9 Progress in Africa: Advancing Infrastructure, Industrialization and Innovation 

Africa continues to make uneven progress towards achieving SDG 9 which aims to “Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation”. Significant challenges remain in all three pillars of SDG 9 across African nations, though bright spots of success and models for acceleration exist.

Infrastructure: Infrastructure development has been prioritized through initiatives like the UN Economic Commission for Africa’s (ECA) Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA) and at a continental level through the African Development Bank’s High 5 priorities which emphasize infrastructure development. However, large infrastructure gaps remain, including lack of access to all-season roads for much of the rural population, limited access to electricity and clean cooking (over 600 million still lack access), and low household access to basic sanitation facilities. Investments in hard and soft infrastructure must increase substantially to meet SDG targets. Innovative financing models like public-private partnerships have sought to help address infrastructure needs where public funding is lacking. Regional integration through infrastructure connectivity projects like the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport (LAPSSET) Corridor project and tripartite free trade agreement can spur growth.

Industrialization: Africa’s industrialization has been slow, with average manufacturing value added per capita in 2016 still below $100 USD compared to over $2,500 in East Asia. However, over the last decade, some countries have seen stronger growth in manufacturing value added, including Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya, and Senegal. Special economic zones and strategic targeting of foreign direct investment in manufacturing have driven industrial growth and job creation in some nations. Industrial policies, trade policies that protect nascent industries, and workforce training will be key to further advancing manufacturing and industrialization. Regional cooperation on harmonizing policies, reducing barriers to trade, and strengthening value chains across borders can accelerate industrial development.  

Innovation: Innovation remains nascent in most African countries, though spending on research and development is increasing, and links between universities and the private sector are strengthening. Several tech hubs and incubation centers have emerged, supporting a growing number of tech-enabled start-ups, especially in the service sector. However, much more needs to be done to foster invention and diffusion of new technologies that can drive productivity, value addition and job growth in key sectors like agriculture, health, and manufacturing. Developing technical and vocational skills, protecting intellectual property, and improving access to finance and markets for African innovators would help drive progress.

 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Europe:

Sustainable Development Goal 9: Building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation 

Progress on SDG 9 remains insufficient to achieve the targets by 2030 according to the UN Secretary-General’s latest SDG progress report. While some improvements have been made in connectivity, renewable energy infrastructure, and access to technology, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted major gaps that still exist in resilient and sustainable infrastructure and industrialization globally.

In the ECE region, advancements in infrastructure have been uneven across countries. The development of transport networks including road and rail infrastructure has accelerated in some countries over the past decade, increasing connectivity and access. However, lack of transport infrastructure remains an obstacle for accessing markets and public services in other countries. Investment in sustainable and resilient infrastructure in energy, water and sanitation also remains well below levels needed to achieve SDG 9 targets.   

The decline in manufacturing output and exports due to the pandemic has highlighted the lack of resilience in industrial production. The nascent rebound in manufacturing has been led primarily by larger firms, while many small and medium-sized enterprises continue to struggle. The crisis has demonstrated the imperative for more sustainable production and consumption patterns, reduction of waste and pollution, and the need for a transition to a circular economy. Progress on education, skills training and lifelong learning also needs to accelerate to adapt the workforce to the green transition.

With respect to technology and innovation, the ECE region remains a global leader, though more needs to be done to ensure access is inclusive and the benefits of new technologies are shared widely. The digital divide has become more apparent during the COVID-19 crisis, demonstrating the urgency of increasing digital connectivity and access to technology for marginalized groups. Public and private spending on research and development, especially in sustainable technologies, needs to increase substantially for the region to achieve the ambitious targets under SDG 9.  

In conclusion, scaling up investment in sustainable and resilient infrastructure, transforming industries to become more sustainable and innovative, and achieving more inclusive access to technology should be top priorities for the ECE region to build back better after COVID-19 and meet the SDG 9 targets. Stronger partnerships between governments, civil society, the private sector and academia will be required to mobilize resources, share knowledge and accelerate progress. With increased commitment by all stakeholders, the region can achieve the vision of sustainable industrialization and innovation for all.


 Here is a draft lengthy analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) for an expert audience:

Sustainable Development Goal 9: Building infrastructure and industrialization for an innovative and sustainable future in Latin America and the Caribbean 

Latin America and the Caribbean has made significant progress on infrastructure and industrialization over the past several decades, with rising investment in roads, ports, telecommunications, and other critical infrastructure as well as a diversifying manufacturing sector and nascent innovation ecosystems. However, major gaps remain in connectivity, sustainability, and inclusiveness. Closing these gaps will be critical for the region to achieve sustainable development and meet the ambitions of the 2030 Agenda.

Infrastructure remains insufficient and unevenly developed in the region. While some countries have managed to close infrastructure gaps, access to essential infrastructure like electricity, water and sanitation, and broadband internet remains scarce for many. Rural and marginalized communities in particular often lack access to infrastructure and basic services. Scaling up investment in infrastructure across the region, with a focus on sustainability and inclusion, will be key to providing universal access. The region requires investment in resilient infrastructure, especially as climate change exacerbates risks from natural disasters. New infrastructure must also be designed sustainably and inclusively to ensure it benefits communities for generations.

Industrialization in the region has advanced in some sectors but remains limited and uneven. Manufacturing value added has grown in countries like Mexico, Brazil and Costa Rica, especially in automobile, aerospace, and medical devices sectors. However, other countries continue to rely heavily on commodity exports. A more diverse, knowledge- and technology-intensive industrial base is needed to drive sustainable growth and job creation. Policies to foster industrial clusters, strengthen value chains, promote technology transfer and adoption, and cultivate innovation ecosystems can help build competitive, green industries. Tax incentives, public-private partnerships, and other tools may attract private sector investment in nascent industries. 

Fostering innovation is critical for the region to achieve SDG 9 and beyond. Latin America and the Caribbean underperforms on most innovation metrics, from R&D spending to patenting rates to technology exports. Nurturing homegrown innovation and technology development can drive industrial and economic growth, address environmental challenges, and improve public service delivery. Innovation policies, partnerships, and funding programs are needed to cultivate research, support startups and technology transfer, and promote collaboration between universities, private sector and government.

In summary, SDG 9 will require coordinated policies and scaled up investment to build sustainable infrastructure, promote inclusive industrialization, and foster innovation in Latin America and the Caribbean...[Additional analysis and recommendations would follow in the full report].


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), targeting an expert audience:

Sustainable Development Goal 9: Progress and Challenges in Asia and the Pacific  

Executive Summary: Significant progress has been made on SDG 9 in Asia and the Pacific, though major challenges remain. Economic growth has led to greater investment in industry and infrastructure, advancing targets 9.1 and 9.2. However, more needs to be done to promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, increase access to financial services, and invest in resilient infrastructure. Innovation continues to accelerate in some economies but lags in others. Regional cooperation will be key to overcoming shared challenges.  

Industrialization and Infrastructure: The Asia-Pacific region has seen steady industrialization and infrastructure development over the past decade, as rapid economic growth, particularly in East and South Asia, has increased domestic resources and attracted foreign direct investment in manufacturing and construction sectors. ESCAP member States have expanded road networks, water and sanitation systems, and access to electricity across large swaths of territory. However, small island developing States and least developed countries still struggle with basic infrastructure deficits. Scale and sustainability remain inadequately addressed throughout the region. Promoting high-quality infrastructure investment and "green" industrialization are critical next steps. 

Technological Innovation: Technology and innovation are propelling economic opportunity and connectivity across the region, with frontier technologies like artificial intelligence poised to transform societies and industries. However, regional inequalities persist, as technology access and innovation capacity tend to correlate strongly with national income levels. To achieve SDG 9, investments in human capital, research and development, and technology diffusion need to be scaled up in lagging countries. Regional cooperation on data sharing, best practices, and joint research and education initiatives can help bridge gaps.

Challenges Ahead: To fully implement SDG 9, Asia-Pacific member States must redouble efforts to: increase public and private investment in sustainable infrastructure; transition industries to greener, more socially inclusive models; expand access to financial tools and services for marginalized groups; boost support for innovation at micro, meso and macro levels; and strengthen regional collaboration in areas such as trade, transportation, and technological exchange. Overcoming these challenges will drive progress across the 2030 Agenda and ensure the region's prosperity and sustainability. Overall, while advancements have been made, much work remains to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation for all across Asia and the Pacific.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) targeting an expert audience:

Sustainable Development Goal 9: Progress and Challenges in the ESCWA Region  

Introduction
SDG 9 aims to "build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation". This goal is crucial for the economic and social development of the ESCWA region, which continues to face significant challenges in developing advanced infrastructure, promoting high-tech industry and innovation, and achieving inclusive and sustainable industrialization. While some progress has been made, accelerated efforts are urgently needed to meet SDG 9 in the region. 

Infrastructure Development 
The ESCWA region significantly lags other regions in infrastructure including transport, energy, water and sanitation, and ICT connectivity. Major infrastructure deficits persist in conflict-affected countries like Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Libya. Large-scale investments in sustainable and resilient infrastructure are urgently needed across the region, with an estimated annual need of $100 billion. Some positive steps have been taken, including Saudi Arabia's $500 billion NEOM mega city project and expanded port and rail networks in the GCC. But much more is needed, requiring greater public-private partnerships and regional coordination.

Advanced Technological Capabilities
The ESCWA region continues to lag in developing advanced technological capabilities, especially in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and other 21st century technologies that are driving the 4th Industrial Revolution. R&D spending remains low, averaging only 0.5% of GDP for the region. While some centers of excellence exist, especially in the high-tech hubs of Israel, technological capabilities vary widely across countries. There is a pressing need to invest in developing skills, supporting tech startups and building regional cooperation on technology. Some progress has been seen in growing tech sectors in Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon. But without major policy changes, the region risks falling further behind in advanced technologies.

 Here is a draft long-form analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of UN DESA targeting an expert audience and focused on middle-income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 9: Progress and Challenges in Middle-Income Countries 

Sustainable Development Goal 9 aims to “build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.” This goal is crucial for continued progress in developing countries, particularly middle-income countries that are industrializing rapidly but still face substantial development challenges. Progress on SDG 9 will require major investments in infrastructure and innovation, as well as policies and partnerships to promote inclusive and sustainable industries. 

Infrastructure and Technology Gaps Persist

Although middle-income countries have seen infrastructure improvements in recent decades, large gaps remain compared to higher-income countries, and further progress is needed to achieve SDG 9. Access to all-season road networks, affordable and reliable energy, and digital connectivity remain out of reach for many in middle-income countries. These infrastructure gaps pose barriers to economic growth, job creation, and improved living standards. New technologies like artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and renewable energy also remain underutilized in middle-income countries, even as they drive rapid change in advanced economies. Policies and investments to boost infrastructure, facilitate technology transfer and build technical skills are urgently needed.

The Need for Inclusive and Sustainable Industrialization

As middle-income countries continue their industrialization, they must pursue strategies that are both socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable to achieve SDG 9. This includes promoting small and medium enterprises, boosting employment in high-productivity economic sectors, and transitioning to renewable energy and circular economy models. However, industrial policies in many middle-income countries currently favor large firms and carbon-intensive sectors. And while manufacturing output has grown rapidly, job growth has lagged due to automation. Targeted policy incentives, partnerships, and retraining programs will be needed to steer industrialization in a sustainable direction that benefits all parts of society.  

[The report would continue for several more paragraphs discussing specific examples, data, policies, and recommendations related to infrastructure, technology, and industrialization gaps in middle-income countries. The overall structure would follow a standard UN DESA analytical report format with an introduction, discussions of key issues and progress, case examples, data, challenges, and recommendations.]


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of the UN Economic Analysis and Policy Division (EAPD) focused on middle income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 9: Progress on Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure in Middle Income Countries  

This report provides an in-depth analysis of the progress made towards SDG 9 on Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, with a particular focus on developments in middle income countries. SDG 9 aims to "build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation". This goal encompasses targets related to infrastructure, industrialization, technology and innovation.

Infrastructure

On infrastructure, significant investments have been made in middle income countries to expand access to transport systems, electricity and ICT. China's Belt and Road Initiative has financed major infrastructure projects across Asia, Africa and Europe. However, large infrastructure gaps remain, with billions still lacking access to basic infrastructure services. Financing these infrastructure needs remains a challenge, with a funding gap of trillions of dollars per year. Private sector participation and public-private partnerships are needed to help close this gap. 

Industrialization 

On industrialization, middle income countries have made progress on raising industry's share of employment and GDP and increasing manufacturing value addition. Countries like India and Vietnam have fostered manufacturing growth and integration into global value chains. However, industrialization in many middle income countries remains concentrated in low-value added and labour-intensive sectors. These countries need to move up the value chain into more high-tech, knowledge-intensive industries. This will require upgrading of skills and technological capabilities, as well as policies to encourage high-tech foreign direct investment.  

Technology and innovation

On technology and innovation, research and development spending has increased in some large middle income countries like China and Brazil but remains very low in others. Technology transfer from high-income countries is growing but at a slow pace. Policies to strengthen intellectual property regimes, boost university-industry collaboration and encourage technology licensing and adaptation are needed. Many middle income countries also need to improve their digital infrastructure and skills to harness the benefits of the digital economy. 

In conclusion, while significant progress has been achieved in middle income countries on SDG 9, major gaps remain in infrastructure, industrialization and technology. Targeted investments, partnerships, and policy improvements are needed to foster more inclusive and sustainable economic growth in these countries over the coming decade.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of the UN DESA Division for Public Institutions and Digital Government (DPIDG) targeting an expert audience and focused on middle-income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 9: Progress and Challenges in Middle-Income Countries  

Sustainable Development Goal 9 aims to “build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.” This goal is critical for continued economic growth and progress in middle-income countries. Infrastructure, industrialization, and innovation are key drivers of job creation, increased productivity and competitiveness, and improved standards of living. However, many middle-income countries face significant challenges in achieving SDG 9 due to lack of investment, technology and skills gaps, and increased economic vulnerability.  

According to the UN Secretary-General’s latest SDG progress report, investment in infrastructure in middle-income countries grew by 4% in 2019 but still falls short of the levels required to sustain economic growth and development. The infrastructure financing gap in these countries is estimated to be over $1 trillion per year. Private sector participation in infrastructure has increased but public investment remains the dominant source of infrastructure finance. Many middle-income countries lack strong public-private partnership frameworks to facilitate greater private sector investment. They also face challenges in developing “bankable” infrastructure projects that meet the risk-return thresholds of private investors.  

On industrialization, the progress report notes that manufacturing value added and employment have steadily increased in middle-income countries, especially in East and South Asia. However, industrial growth remains concentrated in low-skill and labor-intensive sectors. Technological upgrading has been slow, and many countries struggle to transition to higher-value added manufacturing. They face shortages of advanced technical and managerial skills, limited access to technology and innovation, and issues scaling up new innovative firms.  

In terms of innovation, research and development spending in middle-income countries has risen but remains below the world average of 1.7% of GDP. University-industry collaboration on research and technology transfer is limited. Venture capital investment is small and concentrated in a few tech hubs. Most middle-income countries underperform on measures of innovation capability and output. They rely heavily on technology diffusion rather than domestic innovation. 

In conclusion, while middle-income countries have made progress on SDG 9, accelerated efforts are needed to address significant challenges related to infrastructure finance, industrial upgrading, and innovation. Targeted investments, policy reforms, technology transfers, and partnerships can help unlock the potential for resilient infrastructure, sustainable industrialization, and a vibrant innovation ecosystem in these countries. But political will and good governance are also critical to set the necessary conditions for achieving SDG 9.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of the UN DESA Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DISD) targeting an expert audience and with a focus on middle-income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 9: Building Resilient Infrastructure, Promoting Inclusive and Sustainable Industrialization and Fostering Innovation  in Middle-Income Countries

There has been steady progress on SDG 9 in middle-income countries over the past decade, though major gaps remain and challenges threaten continued progress. Robust economic growth in many middle-income countries has enabled increased investment in infrastructure and industry. However, growth has often come at the expense of sustainability and inclusiveness. Greater efforts are needed to direct investment and innovation toward environmentally-friendly and equitable outcomes.  

Infrastructure and Industrialization Gaps Persist
Access to basic infrastructure like roads, water and sanitation remains uneven across and within many middle-income countries. Rural and poor populations frequently lack access, limiting opportunities to improve livelihoods and living standards. Modern and sustainable energy infrastructure also remains scarce, with many still relying on biomass, coal and fossil fuels. Efforts to upgrade and expand sustainable infrastructure must be intensified to enable the transition to sustainable energy and environmental sustainability.

The manufacturing and industrial base of many middle-income countries has expanded significantly, but inclusive and sustainable industrialization is lacking. Polluting and hazardous industries pose environmental threats, while job growth has been uneven. The use of advanced technologies is limited and the digital divide persists for much of the population. Targeted efforts are needed to foster the growth of sustainable industries, expand access to technology, and promote decent work and training opportunities for marginalized groups.  

Fostering Innovation through Partnerships and Policies
Innovation will be key to addressing infrastructure and industrialization challenges, but significant barriers exist in middle-income countries. Limited scientific research and development funding, lack of high-skilled workers, and weak partnerships between industry and academia constrain innovation. Improving policy environments, building research and technical capacities, facilitating knowledge transfers, and strengthening public-private partnerships will help stimulate innovation for sustainability. International cooperation can also support innovation through technical assistance, collaborative research programs, and sharing best practices.

In summary, middle-income countries have seen progress on SDG 9 but major gaps remain to achieve inclusive and sustainable infrastructure, industry and innovation. Targeted investments, policy improvements and international cooperation will be critical to foster environmentally-sound infrastructure and industries, advance access to technology, and stimulate innovation for sustainable development. Progress on SDG 9 in middle-income countries requires a coordinated and accelerated effort across governments, the private sector, and development partners.


 Here is a draft analytical report on SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) targeting an expert audience with a focus on middle-income countries:

SDG 9: Progress and Challenges in Middle-Income Countries 

As we reach the midpoint of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, assessing progress on SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) is critical, especially in middle-income countries which face unique challenges in implementing this goal. This report provides an in-depth review of the progress and obstacles related to SDG 9 based on reports from UN entities including UN DESA, UNDP, UNCTAD, and the regional economic commissions.

In terms of progress, many middle-income countries have expanded access to fixed and mobile broadband connectivity and have growing tech hubs and incubators to support innovation in new technologies like artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and renewable energy. Countries like China and India now have the largest numbers of science and engineering graduates in the world. Foreign direct investment in research and development in middle-income countries has also grown substantially. 

However, major challenges remain. Infrastructure in many middle-income countries continues to be underdeveloped, with lack of access to basic services like electricity, sanitation, and paved roads especially in rural areas and disadvantaged communities. Manufacturing value added as a percent of GDP in middle-income countries has stagnated, as countries struggle with lack of skilled labor, access to finance, and burdensome business regulations. While R&D investment has increased, it remains a small fraction of high-income countries. There are also concerns of growing inequality in access to new technologies.

To accelerate progress on SDG 9, middle-income countries should prioritize improving infrastructure including universal broadband access, upgrade technological skills training, provide greater access to finance for small and medium enterprises, increase public funding for basic and applied research, and promote policies that foster inclusive and environmentally sustainable industrialization. Partnerships with private sector, civil society and international donors will also be key to helping governments fund and implement innovative solutions.

Overall, while significant achievements have been made on SDG 9 in middle-income countries, renewed efforts will be needed to address major gaps that remain to ensure sustainable infrastructure and promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization by 2030. With targeted investments in human and technological capacity, supportive policy environments, and multi-stakeholder partnerships, middle-income countries can chart a path to accelerate progress on this critical goal in the coming decade.

Sustainable Development Goal 9: Building Resilient Infrastructure, Promoting Inclusive and Sustainable Industrialization and Fostering Innovation  

 SDG 9 aims to "build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation". Progress on SDG 9 is critical for development in middle-income countries to enable economic growth, job creation, and improved connectivity and access to markets and services. However, many middle-income countries face significant challenges in achieving SDG 9.

Infrastructure gaps remain large in many middle-income countries, including lack of access to electricity, transportation networks, irrigation infrastructure, and Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). According to UNCTAD, the annual infrastructure gap in developing countries amounts to $2.5 trillion. Access to basic infrastructure services remains uneven across and within many middle-income countries. Rural and poorer populations often lag significantly behind in access to infrastructure like roads, electricity, and ICT. Major investments are needed to upgrade existing infrastructure, expand access, and build resilience to climate change.    

On promoting sustainable industrialization, middle-income countries have made progress in increasing manufacturing value added and exports. However, industrialization in many countries remains resource- and carbon-intensive, contributing significantly to environmental degradation. Transitioning to more sustainable patterns of industrialization remains a key challenge. There is also a need to better link local enterprises, particularly SMEs, to domestic and global value chains. Creating decent industrial jobs, especially for youth and women, remains a priority.

With respect to innovation, middle-income countries continue to lag higher-income countries on research and development spending and scientific publications. However, some middle-income countries are emerging as innovation leaders, with growing investments in research and development, education, and skills training in science, technology, engineering and math. There is significant potential for South-South cooperation on innovation. Partnering with private sector and academia is key to fostering innovation for sustainable development.  

In summary, while middle-income countries have made progress, major efforts are still needed to achieve SDG 9. Significant investments, partnerships, and policy changes are required to address infrastructure gaps, promote sustainable industrialization, boost innovation, and ensure access for marginalized groups. With dedicated action, SDG 9 can drive continued economic and social development in middle-income countries.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of UNDP targeting an expert audience and focusing on middle income countries:

SDG 9: Progress and Challenges in Middle Income Countries  

Introduction 

Sustainable Development Goal 9 aims to “build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation”. This goal encompasses targets related to infrastructure, industrialization and technological progress which are key drivers of economic growth and development. For middle income countries (MICs), progress on SDG 9 is essential to continue economic and social progress, as they start to move up the income ladder. However, MICs also face significant challenges in achieving this goal, including lack of adequate financing, economic volatility, and restricted access to technology and knowledge.  

Infrastructure in MICs

Infrastructure including transport, energy and ICT networks are crucial for enabling trade and mobility, providing access to vital services, and boosting productivity. Many MICs have made progress expanding infrastructure like roads, railways, ports as well as access to electricity. For example, in India the national highway network has increased 50% from 2014 to 2019. However, large infrastructure gaps remain, with over 600 million still lacking access to electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Constraints like lack of funding, limited technical and managerial capacity, and policies or regulations have slowed progress. Attracting private sector investment in infrastructure will be key.  

Industrialization challenges 

The expansion of modern industrial sectors has driven growth in many MICs, yet more progress is needed for inclusive and sustainable industrialization. Manufacturing value added per capita remains low in many regions like Sub-Saharan Africa. Small firm size, lack of skilled workers, restricted trade, and technology access have hindered industrialization. Challenges also remain in improving resource efficiency and limiting pollution. Transitioning to more high-tech, high-value added industries while limiting environmental impacts will require policies and incentives for innovation, education and skills training, and dissemination of clean technologies. 

Fostering innovation

Innovation in areas like digital technologies, biotechnology and renewable energy can help address development challenges, but innovation capacity remains limited in many MICs...[additional details and examples on state of innovation, challenges, and recommendations].

Conclusion

In summary, while MICs have made progress on SDG 9 targets related to infrastructure, industrialization and innovation, major gaps remain and complex challenges must be addressed. With a coordinated effort across governments, the private sector and development partners, MICs can achieve sustainable and inclusive progress on infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization, and foster environmentally-sound technological progress. By accelerating SDG 9, MICs can drive economic growth, create jobs, improve living standards and ensure a sustainable future for all.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of UNCTAD targeting an expert audience with a focus on middle-income countries:

Accelerating progress on SDG 9 in middle-income countries 

Middle-income countries face unique challenges in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 9 which aims to "build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation". While these countries have rapidly developing economies and growing populations demanding more advanced infrastructure and industry, they often lack the institutional capacities, technical skills, and funding to meet these demands sustainably. 

Progress on SDG 9 indicators like share of manufacturing value added, emissions intensity of industry, and mobile broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants has been mixed across middle-income countries. Countries like China, Brazil, and South Africa have well-developed infrastructure and are global leaders in industries like renewable energy, but still face major inefficiencies, pollution, and inequality challenges. Others like India, Nigeria, and Indonesia are still developing basic infrastructure and industrialization and require significant investments to provide universal access while leapfrogging to sustainable technologies and practices.

Middle-income countries would benefit from increased international cooperation, private sector engagement, technology transfer, and blended finance to achieve SDG 9. South-South cooperation can help countries learn from one another's experiences developing sustainable industry and infrastructure. The private sector should be incentivized through risk mitigation tools, tax incentives and business models that align profits with sustainability to invest in middle-income markets. New green technologies like renewable energy storage, electric vehicles, and green hydrogen need to be shared at affordable costs with middle-income countries. Blended finance, combining public and private money, can help de-risk projects to mobilize greater investments.

Trade and investment in environmentally sound technologies are also critical for middle-income countries to develop sustainably...[Additional analysis and examples on 2-3 pages]

In summary, while middle-income countries have opportunities for rapid progress on SDG 9, international cooperation is needed to strengthen their capacities, provide affordable financing and technology access, and encourage green private sector growth. With targeted investments and knowledge sharing focused on sustainability, middle-income countries can develop advanced infrastructure and industries that power their economies while protecting the planet. But the window for action is closing fast. Urgent action is needed to put these countries on track for green, resilient and inclusive growth.  


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Africa targeting an expert audience with a focus on middle-income countries:

Progress on SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure in Middle-Income Countries  

This report provides an in-depth analysis on the progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 9 on building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation in middle-income countries, especially in Africa. Overall, progress on SDG 9 in middle-income countries has been uneven and insufficient to meet the ambitious targets by 2030. While some countries have made advancements in infrastructure development, innovation capacity, and industrialization, much more needs to be done given the rapid population growth and development needs of middle-income countries.

Infrastructure remains inadequate in many middle-income countries, especially in growing cities and rural areas. Access to all-season roads, railways, ports, and air transportation is still lacking for many communities. Investment in sustainable and resilient infrastructure through official development assistance and private investment has not matched the scale of needs. New financing models and partnerships are urgently needed to fund critical infrastructure gaps. Advancements in digital connectivity and access to information and communications technology has been more promising, but the digital divide continues to persist in many countries.  

On industrialization, middle-income countries have seen growth in manufacturing sectors like agro-processing, textiles and extractives, but local value addition and diversification into higher value-added sectors remains limited. Transitioning to sustainable industrial practices has been slow. Policy and regulatory environments are not fully conducive to private sector growth and sustainable industrial development. More policy support is needed for eco-industrial parks, sustainable and innovation-led industrial strategies, and developing domestic capabilities in new technologies like artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and renewable energy. 

Innovation ecosystems in most middle-income countries are nascent. Investments in research and development are low by global standards. Technical and vocational education training programs are not delivering the skills needed for the future of work. There are pockets of success in entrepreneurial hubs and tech startups, but innovative activity is concentrated in a few major cities.  Partnerships between universities, private sector, and government on research need significant scaling up. Expenditures on scientific research and innovative technology adoption need to be dramatically increased in both public and private spheres to drive progress on SDG 9.

In summary, while middle-income countries have seen laudable improvements in infrastructure, industrialization and innovation, the pace of progress is not fast enough and unlikely to meet the SDG 9 targets by 2030 without significant policy interventions, increased public and private investments, advances in education and skills, deepened regional partnerships, and adoption of new sustainable technologies and financing models. With a concerted effort across these areas, middle-income countries can make major strides towards resilient and sustainable infrastructure, innovation ecosystems, and inclusive industrial development. But the clock is ticking, and the next decade is crucial.


 Here is a draft long-form analytical report on SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Europe targeting an expert audience focused on middle-income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 9: Progress on Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure in Middle-Income Countries 

Middle-income countries have seen steady progress on SDG 9 over the past year, though significant challenges remain. On the targets related to resilient infrastructure, access to ICT, and promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization (Targets 9.1, 9.c and 9.2 respectively), MICs have expanded infrastructure networks, increased broadband connectivity and pursued new industrial policies, but gaps in access and implementation continue, especially for marginalized groups.

On infrastructure (Target 9.1), the expansion of road, rail and port networks across MICs has reduced travel times and shipping costs for many communities and businesses. However, rural and remote areas remain disconnected from national and regional infrastructure networks which limits their sustainable socioeconomic development.   Investment in renewable energy infrastructure has accelerated in many MICs, increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. But energy access remains unreliable for over 1 billion people, mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia.

Broadband access (Target 9.c) continues to expand rapidly, with over 4 billion people connecting to mobile broadband networks in 2020. However, penetration rates remain below 50% in many MICs and connectivity speeds and quality of service vary widely within countries. Meaningful broadband adoption for marginalized groups like women, elderly, migrants and persons with disabilities continues to lag in many MICs.

On industrialization (Target 9.2), new industrial policies in many MICs focus on diversifying production, skills development and technology upgrades. But industrial policy implementation has proved challenging, global economic uncertainty threatens export demand, and the industrial workforce is under strain from automation and job insecurity. The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the vulnerability of industrial supply chains in many MICs.  

Progress on these SDG 9 targets will require massive public and private investments in resilient infrastructure, the diffusion of new technologies, and the greening of industries. But equally important will be policy actions to address issues like rural-urban divides, inequality of access, threats to decent work, and economic vulnerability. With strong, coordinated action and political will, SDG 9 can be achieved across middle-income countries within the coming decade. Overall, while there has been progress, accelerated action is needed.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 9 (SDG 9):

Report on Progress Towards SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure in Middle-Income Countries  

Executive Summary: This report provides an in-depth analysis of the progress of middle-income countries towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 9, focused on building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation. The report draws on data and analyses from UN DESA, UNCTAD, UNIDO, and the five UN regional commissions, with a particular focus on trends in Latin America and the Caribbean as analyzed by ECLAC.  

Progress on SDG 9 is mixed across the developing world. On the positive side, many middle-income countries have made strides in improving access to infrastructure like roads, electricity, and telecommunications, as well as promoting the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises which drive job creation. However, major challenges remain to channel infrastructure and industrial investments towards more sustainable and equitable outcomes, build productive capacities beyond low-skilled sectors, foster high-tech innovation, and mitigate environmental impacts.  

In Latin America and the Caribbean, infrastructure investments have improved connectivity and access to electricity, but road infrastructure and ports remain limited. The region has a growing number of SMEs, but industrialization continues to be concentrated in low-skill, resource-intensive sectors, and integration into global value chains is limited. While the number of researchers and spending on science and technology is increasing, most countries remain "modest innovators" according to the Global Innovation Index. Pollution levels also remain high due to unsustainable agricultural, industrial and transport practices.  

To accelerate progress on SDG 9, policy interventions should aim to: increase public and private infrastructure investments, especially in sustainable transport and renewable energy; support SME development in higher-productivity sectors through skills training and access to credit; boost innovation spending and strengthen research institutions; enact policies to attract high-tech firms and support startups; and incentivize sustainable production and consumption patterns across industries. Regional cooperation on infrastructure, trade, and industrial policy can also help countries achieve economies of scale and build competitive advantages.

With targeted, coordinated action across these areas, middle-income countries can advance SDG 9 and place their economies on a more sustainable and inclusive growth trajectory. But success will require political will and policies tuned to country-specific priorities and capacities. With the COVID-19 crisis straining resources, international partnership and assistance may also be needed to help close infrastructure gaps and revive industries in the most vulnerable economies.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 9 (SDG 9) in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) targeting an expert audience and focused on middle-income countries:

Progress on SDG 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation in middle-income countries 

Middle-income countries in the Asia-Pacific region have seen steady progress on SDG 9 over the past several years, though significant challenges remain to achieve the ambitious targets by 2030. On target 9.1 to "Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all," connections to road networks have expanded and access to electricity has increased across the region. However, large infrastructure gaps persist, with over 400 million still lacking access to electricity. Financing these infrastructure needs remains a challenge, with an annual funding gap of $2.5 trillion. Public-private partnerships and regional cooperation on infrastructure projects could help mobilize additional financing.  

On target 9.2 to "Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry's share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed countries," the share of manufacturing value added as a percentage of GDP has grown in middle-income countries, but industrialization remains uneven and concentrated in a few large economies like China and India. The adoption of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial practices has been slow. Transitioning to a circular economy model could drive more sustainable use of natural resources while boosting job creation in new green economy sectors like renewable energy. 

On target 9.5 to "Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries, including, by 2030, encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and development workers per 1 million people and public and private research and development spending," research and development spending in middle-income countries has steadily increased, but remains well below levels in advanced economies. Skilled human capital remains limited. International cooperation on technology transfer and scientific knowledge sharing with advanced economies could accelerate innovation and the adoption of more advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and robotics which promise to drive future economic growth...

[Additional analysis and details on other 9.x indicators and targets as well as country-level examples and data would follow...]

In summary, while middle-income countries have made progress on infrastructure development, industrialization, and innovation in line with SDG 9, more needs to be done to fill significant gaps, mobilize financing, promote sustainability and inclusion, build human capital, and drive faster technological upgrading and adoption. Regional cooperation and partnerships with advanced economies provide avenues to accelerate progress on SDG 9 to achieve resilient, sustainable, and innovation-driven economic growth over the next decade.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) targeting an expert audience and focused on middle-income countries:

SDG 9: Building Resilient Infrastructure, Promoting Inclusive and Sustainable Industrialization and Fostering Innovation

Progress on SDG 9 in the ESCWA region, comprised primarily of middle-income countries, has been uneven. While some countries have made strides in improving infrastructure, boosting industry and enabling innovation, much more needs to be done to achieve the ambitious targets under this goal by 2030.  

On target 9.1 on developing quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, the region has seen growth in road networks, power generation capacity and access to electricity. However, significant infrastructure gaps remain, especially in the areas of renewable energy, public transport and broadband connectivity. Investment in infrastructure needs to increase from the current 3-4% of GDP in most countries to the 7-8% range to meet the huge demand. Governments need to strengthen the enabling environment for public-private partnerships to help close the financing gap.

Progress on target 9.2 on promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization has been slow. Manufacturing only comprises around 10% of GDP for most middle-income economies in the region, well below the 20% target. Industrial policies remain scarce, uncoordinated and largely aspire to attract foreign investment in low-skill sectors. Diversification into higher-value added industries and greater economic complexity are urgently needed. A new generation of industrial policies focused on skills, technology, sustainability and inclusion should be adopted.  

Target 9.5 on enhancing scientific research and upgrading technological capabilities is advancing but at an insufficient pace. R&D spending remains below 1% of GDP across most of the region. Policy frameworks often lack clear visions, incentives, and monitoring mechanisms to stimulate innovation in the private sector. Greater investments are needed in human capital, research infrastructure, technology extension services, and fostering linkages between universities and industry. 

In conclusion, while some positive steps are being taken by countries in the region, accelerated progress across all targets under SDG 9 is needed to spur sustainable industrialization, build resilient infrastructure and foster innovation. By adopting forward-looking policies, scaling investments and forging new partnerships, countries can achieve the ambitions espoused under this vital SDG. But the clock is ticking to transform economies and lives by 2030.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, in the style of UN DESA targeting an expert audience:

SDG 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation                                                                                                                                                      

Progress on SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure remains uneven across regions and country classifications. While some middle-income countries have made advances in infrastructure, innovation capacity, and industrialization, many least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries continue to face significant challenges in achieving SDG 9.

In terms of infrastructure, access to road networks, electricity, and telecommunications has expanded in many parts of the world. However, major infrastructure gaps remain in poorer regions like sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia and the Pacific. There are still over 1 billion people without access to roads, over 600 million without access to electricity, and over 3.6 billion without access to the internet. Investment in sustainable and resilient infrastructure remains well below estimated needs. Innovative funding mechanisms, public-private partnerships, and increased aid will be required to meet infrastructure needs and build resilience, especially in vulnerable nations.  

With respect to industrialization, global manufacturing output and trade have steadily increased, driven by growth in East and South Asia. However, the poorest nations have struggled to develop strong manufacturing bases and remain heavily dependent on commodity exports. They require support to diversify their economies, invest in new technologies, build industrial parks and special economic zones, and integrate into regional and global value chains. Providing affordable and sustainable energy to industries remains a key challenge.

On innovation, research and development spending has risen in many parts of the world, patent applications have surged, and new technologies like artificial intelligence and biotechnology continue to spread. However, innovation capacity remains weak in most developing nations due to underinvestment in research, lack of high-skilled workers, and limited collaboration between universities, research institutes and industry. Strengthening technical and vocational education and training programs will be key to fostering innovation in these nations. 

In conclusion, accelerated progress on SDG 9 will require targeted interventions to meet the unique needs of the poorest and most vulnerable countries. Increased aid, partnerships, and technology and knowledge transfers from more advanced economies will be crucial to driving infrastructure development, industrialization, and innovation in nations that need it most. With only 10 years left to achieve the SDGs, the international community must intensify its efforts to ensure no one is left behind when it comes to building industry, innovation and infrastructure.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), targeting an expert audience:

Sustainable Development Goal 9: Progress and Challenges in Asia and the Pacific  

Target 9.1: Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all.

Infrastructure development in Asia and the Pacific remains uneven across subregions and country groups. While East and North Asia have made substantial progress in recent decades, Southeast Asia, South and Southwest Asia, and the Pacific island countries still face major infrastructure gaps that hamper economic growth and the wellbeing of communities. These subregions, along with the region’s least developed countries (LDCs) and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), face challenges in mobilizing much-needed investments in infrastructure such as power plants, road and rail networks, ports and telecommunications. There are also gaps in access to basic infrastructure services, with over 400 million still lacking access to electricity. 

Given these challenges, regional cooperation on infrastructure and multi-stakeholder partnerships are critical to mobilizing finance and knowledge to meet infrastructure needs in lagging subregions and country groups. This includes facilitating public-private partnerships, tackling investment barriers, sharing best practices on resilient infrastructure, and enhancing project preparation and implementation capacity. Regional financing mechanisms such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and ESCAP’s Asia-Pacific Infrastructure Fund, backed by countries with more advanced infrastructure, can also help address infrastructure gaps across the region by providing concessional loans and grants for high-quality, sustainable projects. With its expertise in regional connectivity, ESCAP continues to support its member States through analytical work, capacity-building activities and intergovernmental platform on infrastructure issues.

Small island developing States (SIDS) face unique challenges as islands are often located far from major markets, with small populations and narrow resource bases. They are also disproportionately affected by disasters and climate change impacts like sea level rise, posing risks to critical infrastructure. Infrastructure projects need to be resilient to these impacts, but small size and geographical isolation mean higher costs for infrastructure development in SIDS. While initiatives like the Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific outline key priorities for infrastructure in the Pacific SIDS, financing and capacity gaps remain. Regional support for SIDS will be crucial to improve access to sustainable infrastructure services and build resilience.

 Here is a draft fictional analytical report in the style of the UN Development Policy and Analysis Division (DPIDG) on Sustainable Development Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure with a focus on least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS) and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs):

Progress on SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure in Vulnerable Countries 

Industrialization, technological progress, and infrastructure development remain major challenges for the world’s most vulnerable nations including LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs. These countries face significant obstacles to developing sustainable and resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation. They struggle with limited access to finance, technology, markets, and skills which hamper efforts to build infrastructure, diversify economies and encourage entrepreneurship.  

 LDCs in particular have weak productive capacities and export primarily raw materials and commodities with little value addition. Manufacturing value added per capita in LDCs grew by only 3.8% annually from 2005 to 2017 compared to 6.7% in other developing countries. The share of manufacturing in LDCs’ GDP remained almost unchanged at 11% from 2010 to 2017. Infrastructural deficiencies also pose serious problems in LDCs, with only 34% of the population having access to electricity and 66% having access to basic drinking water services as of 2017.  

Small island developing states face unique challenges including small populations, limited natural resources, susceptibility to climate change and natural disasters, and dependence on food and fuel imports. This makes building resilient infrastructure and diversifying economies especially critical yet challenging. Tourism dominates many SIDS economies, comprising more than 30% of GDP in some countries, highlighting the need to promote other sectors.  

Landlocked developing countries similarly struggle with geographic isolation, lack of territorial access to the sea, and high transit dependence on other countries. This results in high transport and transaction costs which reduce trade competitiveness and the ability to participate in regional and global value chains. Limited access to seaports and maritime transport infrastructure pose serious impediments to growth.  

Accelerated progress on SDG 9 in vulnerable countries will require increased international support and cooperation. This includes: (1) scaling up aid for trade and investment in productive capacity building; (2) increasing financing for infrastructure including renewable energy, ICT and transport; (3) improving access to technology and strengthening technological capabilities; (4) facilitating participation in global value chains; (5) promoting entrepreneurship and small and medium-sized enterprises; and (6) enhancing regional cooperation on infrastructure, trade, and industrial development. Partnerships between governments, the private sector, civil society and multilateral organizations will be key to catalyzing inclusive and sustainable industrialization in vulnerable countries.


 Here is a draft long analytical report on SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DISD), targeting an expert audience and focusing on least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS) and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs):

SDG 9: Progress on building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation in LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs

I. Introduction 

SDG 9 aims to "build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation". This goal is critical for the economic and social development of LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs which often lack access to infrastructure, have nascent industrial sectors and limited capacity for innovation. Progress in these areas can drive economic growth, job creation and improved living standards. However, these countries face significant obstacles due to lack of financing, small domestic markets, geographic isolation, vulnerability to economic shocks and natural disasters and lack of advanced technologies and skills. Accelerated progress on SDG 9 will require targeted international support.

 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of the UN Division for Sustainable Development Goals, targeting an expert audience and focusing on least developed countries, small island developing States, and landlocked developing countries:

SDG 9: Building Resilient and Inclusive Infrastructure and Fostering Innovation in Vulnerable Countries  

Sustainable and inclusive economic growth requires investment in infrastructure and innovation, especially in countries facing unique challenges due to geography, size, and level of development. While there has been progress on SDG 9 at the global level, vulnerable countries including least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing States (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) continue to lag due to lack of access to finance, technology, markets and higher costs of building infrastructure.   

For LDCs, increasing total investment in infrastructure, especially in energy, transportation and ICT, is crucial to enable structural economic transformation, achieve inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation. Despite increasing foreign direct investment flows to LDCs, domestic investment in infrastructure remains very low at 3-4% of GDP. Public spending on infrastructure, education and health combined remains under 10% of GDP for many LDCs, well below what is needed to achieve the SDGs. Donor funding for infrastructure, while increasing, also remains insufficient. Innovative financing mechanisms, including public-private partnerships, development finance, pooled funding, and stock exchanges dedicated to infrastructure bonds and securities could help close the annual $2.5 trillion infrastructure gap in developing countries and unlock private sector potential.  

For SIDS, infrastructure development faces not only lack of finance but also high costs due to factors like remoteness, dispersion, vulnerability to natural disasters, and small domestic markets. ICT connectivity and access are particularly crucial for SIDS to overcome geographic barriers, diversify economies and foster innovation. Undersea broadband cables and satellite systems can help improve access and reduce cost. Renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies are also strategic for SIDS to reduce dependence on expensive fossil fuel imports, provide universal access to energy, and build climate resilience. Targeted technology and knowledge transfers from development partners will be key to scale up these solutions.

 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of the UN Division for Sustainable Development Goals:

SDG 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation

Progress on SDG 9 remains uneven across regions and country groups. Least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries continue to face significant challenges in achieving SDG 9 due to lack of access to finance, technology, and markets. 

In least developed countries, industrialization has been slow to moderate. The share of manufacturing in GDP in LDCs grew from 9.8% in 2000 to 11.5% in 2018, but still lags far behind the world average of 16.6%. LDCs struggle with limited access to electricity, ICT infrastructure, and transportation networks which hampers industrial development. Only about 13% of households in LDCs have access to the Internet, and nearly 600 million in LDCs still lack access to electricity. Investment in research and development in LDCs also remains low at 0.3% of GDP. Targeted efforts are needed to promote investments in energy infrastructure, developing digital connectivity, improving trade facilitation, and boosting investments in science and technology.

Small island developing states face unique challenges including small populations, limited resources, remoteness, and vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters. These structural constraints hinder the development of resilient infrastructure and industrial capacity. Many SIDS depend heavily on tourism for economic growth but remain vulnerable to external shocks. There is a need for SIDS to diversify their economies by promoting sectors like sustainable fisheries, agriculture, and services. Improving access to technology and building digital capabilities can help SIDS overcome geographic isolation. International support for building resilient infrastructure and improving transportation connectivity is vital.

Landlocked developing countries often face high trade costs due to lack of territorial access to the sea and high transit costs. This hinders their industrial development and integration into the global economy. Difficult geography also makes infrastructure development more costly. LLDCs need assistance in developing transit infrastructure like roads, railways, inland waterways and pipelines which can help reduce trade costs. Improving trade facilitation and logistics, easing restrictions on services trade, promoting access to seaports and simplifying border crossing procedures can significantly boost the industrialization of LLDCs.  

In summary, targeted interventions are urgently needed to promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and infrastructure development in countries with special needs. Building productive capacities, improving access to technology and trade, increasing investments in energy and transportation, and diversifying economies are all actions that can set LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS on a path to achieving SDG 9. But success will require strong political will, partnerships, and international cooperation and support.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of UNDP targeting an expert audience:

Sustainable Development Goal 9: Progress and Challenges in Enabling Sustainable Industrialization and Promoting Innovation in Vulnerable Countries

This report provides an in-depth assessment of progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 9, focused specifically on least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). As highlighted in the UN Secretary-General’s 2018 SDG progress report, while many countries have seen advances in infrastructure, industrialization and technological capabilities, vulnerable nations continue to face significant challenges that threaten the achievement of SDG 9 targets. 

In LDCs, limited access to resources, weak institutional and policy frameworks, and lack of economic diversification have constrained industrial growth, infrastructure development and technological innovation. The average share of manufacturing in LDCs’ GDP in 2018 was only 11%, far below the 20% target. The majority of infrastructure in LDCs remains underdeveloped or poorly maintained. Technological capabilities also continue to lag, with low rates of research and development investment and limited access to technology and knowledge resources. Accelerating the development of sustainable industries and resilient infrastructure in LDCs will require targeted policy, financial and technical support from development partners.

SIDS face unique challenges in implementing SDG 9 due to their small size, geographic isolation and vulnerability to external shocks. With limited natural resources and narrow production bases focused on sectors like tourism, SIDS struggle to develop diverse, sustainable industrial and manufacturing sectors. They also face disproportionately high costs for building and maintaining infrastructure due to diseconomies of scale and geographic remoteness. Access to technology and innovation is impeded by small markets, lack of resources and limited connectivity. International cooperation and dedicated assistance on technology transfer and infrastructure development are critical to overcoming these inherent challenges facing SIDS.

In LLDCs, lack of territorial access to the sea, remoteness and isolation from world markets hamper the development of industries and trade connectivity. On average, the manufacturing share of GDP in LLDCs is just over 10%. Infrastructure in LLDCs remains underdeveloped, with poor-quality road and rail networks and limited access to energy and ICT. Investment in research and technology is well below ideal levels. Support for developing transport infrastructure, facilitating trade and enhancing access to technology and innovation through partnerships will be key to unlocking the development potential of LLDCs.   

In summary, while select indicators show progress, vulnerable countries continue to face systemic challenges that threaten the achievement of SDG 9. Tailored policy, financial and technical support for these groups of countries is urgently needed to enable the development of sustainable industries and infrastructure and to build resilience in the face of environmental and economic vulnerabilities. With dedicated cooperation and assistance from the international community, significant strides can still be made towards achieving SDG 9 targets across all countries over the next decade.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of UNCTAD targeting an expert audience:

Sustainable Development Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation  

 progress in least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries

Summary and Key Messages:

Progress on SDG 9 across LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs remains insufficient to meet the targets by 2030. Major infrastructure gaps persist, industrialization is limited, and innovation capacity is weak.  Targeted action is urgently needed to mobilize investment, strengthen productive capacity, and reduce vulnerabilities to shocks.  

Infrastructure: Infrastructure in LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs remains inadequate, undermining prospects for sustainable development. Road density in LDCs is only 34 km per 100 sq. km of land area, compared with 148 km in other developing countries. Only about 30% of rural areas in LDCs have access to all-season roads. Access to electricity in LDCs increased from 58% to 67% between 2015 to 2018 but still lags far behind the developing country average of 90%. Internet bandwidth per internet user in LDCs is 7 kbit/s, 125 times lower than in developed countries. Similar sizable gaps exist in transport, water and sanitation, and ICT infrastructure. Closing these gaps will require major increases in public and private infrastructure investment.

Industrialization: Industrialization in LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs remains limited, with weak productive capacities, low manufacturing value added, and high economic vulnerability. The share of manufacturing in GDP in LDCs is only 12% compared to 16% for other developing countries. Low industrial diversity and limited participation in global value chains exacerbate vulnerability to external shocks. Targeted efforts are needed to strengthen productive capacities, especially in agricultural modernization, agro-industries, and other sectors where LDCs may have competitive advantages. 

Innovation: Innovation capacity in LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs is weak, reflecting low levels of R&D spending, scientific publications, and patent applications. R&D spending in LDCs is only 0.4% of GDP compared to 0.8% in other developing countries. The number of scientific publications in LDCs per million inhabitants is only 5 compared to 142 in other developing countries. Support is urgently needed to strengthen innovation systems, expand ICT infrastructure, improve technical skills, and forge links between research institutions and industry.

In conclusion, while there has been some progress, accelerated action is urgently needed to strengthen infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation in LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs. Targeted measures should prioritize affordable access to basic infrastructure, building productive capacities and export diversification, agricultural modernization, and improving links between research, industry and global innovation networks. With concerted support, LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs can make marked progress towards SDG 9 by 2030.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) targeting an expert audience:

SDG 9: Progress and Challenges in Infrastructure, Industrialization and Innovation in  Africa’s Vulnerable States  

Infrastructure, industrialization and innovation are crucial drivers of sustainable economic growth and job creation, especially in Africa’s least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS) and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). However, these groups of countries face severe challenges in achieving SDG 9 due to lack of investment, technology gaps, geographical disadvantages and vulnerability to external shocks.  

Progress in infrastructure development in Africa’s vulnerable states has been slow and uneven. While there have been improvements in access to basic infrastructure like electricity, water and sanitation, large infrastructure gaps remain, especially in transportation and ICT. Many people still lack access to all-season roads, railways and broadband internet. These infrastructure gaps significantly raise the cost of accessing markets and economic opportunities. They are particularly damaging for landlocked and island nations. Major investments in sustainable transport, energy and ICT infrastructure are urgently needed to support trade, industrialization and service delivery. 

On industrialization, Africa’s LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs have witnessed little structural transformation of their economies. They remain heavily dependent on agriculture and commodity exports, with poorly developed manufacturing and service sectors. This lack of diversification and over-reliance on volatile commodity markets makes their economies vulnerable to external shocks. Targeted efforts are needed to promote value addition, improve business environments, increase access to finance, and build human capital for industrialization. New and emerging technologies should be leveraged to catalyze sustainable industrial development.  

In the area of innovation, LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs in Africa continue to trail the rest of the world. Limited access to technology, lack of investment in research and development, poor scientific infrastructure and ‘brain drain’ of skilled professionals have hampered technological progress. Improved access to the internet and strengthened technical skills are urgently required, especially for women and youth, to drive grassroots innovation and adopt new technologies. Partnerships with more advanced developing countries can help facilitate technology transfer and diffusion.  

In conclusion, accelerated efforts and dedicated investments are critically needed to improve infrastructure, advance sustainable industrialization, and boost innovation in Africa’s most vulnerable country groups. With strong regional cooperation and global partnerships, these countries can make rapid progress towards achieving SDG 9 and inclusive growth. But without targeted interventions and support, they remain at risk of being left behind.

Sustainable Development Goal 9: Progress and Challenges in Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure 

While progress has been made in industrialization, infrastructure development, and innovation across all country groups since 2015, least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries continue to face significant challenges in achieving SDG 9. 

In least developed countries, the share of manufacturing in GDP has only increased slightly, from 10% to 12% from 2015 to 2019. Infrastructure in key sectors like transport, energy and ICT remains underdeveloped. Access to electricity has improved but remains very low at just over 50% of the population. Road density also remains the lowest of all country groups. Investment in research and development is negligible. Without significant increases in investment, industrialization and infrastructure development will continue to lag. Support through official development assistance and investment in resilient infrastructure will be critical for overcoming geographical impediments to economic development.

Small island developing states have also experienced slow progress in industrialization and limited infrastructure development. As island economies dependent on tourism and trade, sustainable industrialization through the growth of more knowledge- and technologically- intensive industries will be key to economic diversification and resilience. However, innovation capacity is hindered by lack of advanced education and limited research sectors. Access to technology and high speed broadband remains a challenge. Investment is needed in sustainable transport and energy infrastructure that is resilient to disasters and climate change. 

Landlocked developing countries face additional challenges due to their geographical positions remote from major trading routes and ports. They depend heavily on transit countries for access to international markets. Industrial growth has been higher than other groups but mainly limited to lower-value added commodities and extractive industries. Improving transport links, reducing transit costs and delays, increasing trade facilitation and economic diversification into more knowledge-intensive industries should be key priorities. Regional cooperation on infrastructure development including energy and ICT networks could help overcome geographical disadvantages.

In conclusion, while progress has been steady, deeply entrenched challenges persist especially for vulnerable country groups. Targeted investment, partnerships, regional cooperation and trade facilitation will be critical for the sustainable and resilient development of industry and infrastructure. Renewed commitment to data collection and analysis will strengthen the monitoring of progress in all areas of SDG 9.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of ECLAC and focused on least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 9 aims to “build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation”. This goal is of critical importance for least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries that often face significant challenges in developing sustainable infrastructure and promoting inclusive economic growth. 

For least developed countries, infrastructure deficits remain large, with over 600 million people still lacking access to electricity and over 800 million lacking access to basic sanitation facilities according to the UN. Significant investments in basic infrastructure like roads, bridges, ports, energy generation and distribution systems are urgently needed. However, least developed countries also need support in developing sustainable infrastructure - adopting renewable energy sources, improving public transport systems, upgrading existing infrastructure to cope with the effects of climate change. They require financing, technology transfer and capacity building to “leapfrog” traditional infrastructure development pathways and transition directly to more advanced and sustainable solutions.

Small island developing states face severe threats from climate change, including sea level rise, coastal erosion, and more intense natural disasters like hurricanes and cyclones. They urgently need support in adapting critical infrastructure like roads, ports, airports, and utilities to better withstand these threats. There is also a need for these countries to transition to more sustainable energy sources given their heavy dependence on imported fossil fuels. However, their small size and isolation present additional challenges in infrastructure and industrial development. Regional cooperation and partnerships with development partners can help address issues like economies of scale and mobilize resources.  

Landlocked developing countries often face higher costs for infrastructure development due to their geographical disadvantages. Investing in transit infrastructure like roads and railways that provide connections to sea ports in neighboring countries is critical for improving trade and economic growth. There is also a need for dry ports, logistics hubs, and stronger regional transit agreements and corridors. Sustainable transport systems are important for limiting pollution and reducing fossil fuel dependence. Technological solutions like solar-powered railways could be especially impactful.

In summary, fulfilling SDG 9 will require a redoubling of efforts to finance and build sustainable infrastructure in least developed countries, small island developing states and landlocked developing countries.  Mobilizing public and private finance, facilitating technology transfer, and providing targeted capacity building support are urgently needed. Regional cooperation and partnerships will also be essential for addressing the specific challenges faced by these groups of countries. With concerted action, major progress can be achieved in upgrading infrastructure, transitioning to sustainable industrialization and spurring innovation even in the most disadvantaged countries.

SDG 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation

Progress on SDG 9 remains uneven across the Asia-Pacific region, especially in least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries. Infrastructure development continues to lag in many countries, limiting connectivity, accessibility, and economic opportunity. Rapid urbanization is putting additional strain on infrastructure and exposing vulnerabilities. At the same time, the region remains the fastest-growing in the world, offering opportunities for sustainable and resilient infrastructure investments that can drive progress across the 2030 Agenda.

Infrastructure and industrialization: Infrastructure development in Asia and the Pacific requires an estimated $1.7 trillion per year to meet the basic needs of citizens. Despite increasing investments, especially through cooperation frameworks like the Belt and Road Initiative, infrastructure in least developed countries and small island developing states remains limited, uneven and poorly adapted to climate change impacts. Industrialization has accelerated in East and Southeast Asia but remains nascent in other subregions. The lack of adequate infrastructure and limited industrial capacity are mutually reinforcing and continue to hamper economic diversification, connectivity, and resilience. With rapid urbanization, demand for infrastructure and basic services in cities is far outstripping supply, leading to increased slum populations and higher disaster risk. 

Innovation and new technologies: The region is a global leader in technological innovation, with countries like China, India and Malaysia emerging as innovation powerhouses. However, technological capabilities and access remain uneven. Internet access ranges from nearly universal in some countries to less than 10% in others. Access to broadband and ICT infrastructure is particularly limited in remote, rural and poorer areas as well as small island developing states. Innovation policy frameworks and government funding for research and development are also limited or non-existent in several countries. At the same time, the rise of frontier technologies like AI, robotics and 5G connectivity present opportunities for leapfrogging development through targeted investments, training and institutional capacity building.

In summary, accelerating progress on SDG 9 in Asia and the Pacific, especially in disadvantaged countries, will require substantial investments in sustainable, resilient and technologically-enabled infrastructure, support for industrialization and innovation policy, focus on skills development and institutional capacity building, and regional cooperation on connectivity, technology access and best practices. With the world's most dynamic economies, the region has the potential to drive progress on SDG 9, but greater efforts and investments in inclusiveness are urgently needed.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) with a focus on least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 9: Building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation   

Progress on SDG 9 in the Arab region, particularly in least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries, has been uneven and faces significant challenges. While some countries have made advancements in infrastructure, industrialization and innovation, many still struggle with lack of investment, limited economic diversification, and over-reliance on natural resource exports. 

Infrastructure remains a key barrier to development in many Arab countries. Access to all-season road networks, affordable and reliable energy, and broadband internet remain limited, especially in rural and remote areas. Several landlocked and small island developing states face severe challenges in accessing infrastructure and resources due to their geographic locations. Investment in infrastructure in the region has declined in recent years and still falls far short of levels needed to fill infrastructure gaps. New sources of funding and financing must be unlocked to upgrade infrastructure and build resilience to climate change impacts like sea level rise, droughts and water scarcity.

Progress on industrialization in the region has slowed, and countries remain dependent on oil and natural resource exports. The contribution of manufacturing value added to GDP in the region is half the global average. Economic diversification efforts have had limited success, especially in Gulf countries highly dependent on oil and gas. Innovation levels also remain low. R&D spending in the region is a fraction of global leaders. Several countries have launched science, technology and innovation strategies and policies but require stronger implementation and partnerships with private sector and academia to foster innovation.

To accelerate progress on SDG 9, countries must increase public and private investment in resilient and sustainable infrastructure, promote inclusive industrialization and foster innovation. Regional cooperation on infrastructure and industrialization strategies can help countries maximize resources and knowledge sharing. Partnerships across regional stakeholders from government, private sector, academia and civil society are key to overcoming challenges, transferring technical skills and unlocking new funding sources to achieve SDG 9 in the region. Progress on this goal can drive economic growth, job creation, trade and overall sustainable development in Arab least developed countries, small island developing states and landlocked developing countries.
