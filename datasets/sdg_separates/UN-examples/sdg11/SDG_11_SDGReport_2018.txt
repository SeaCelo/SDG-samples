Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable
Many cities around the world are facing acute challenges in managing rapid urbanizationâ€” from ensuring adequate housing and infrastructure to support growing populations,
to confronting the environmental impact of urban sprawl, to reducing vulnerability to disasters.
fBetween 2000 and 2014, the proportion of the global urban population living in slums dropped from 28.4 per cent to 22.8 per cent. However, the actual number of people living in slums increased from 807 million to 883 million.
fBased on data collected for 214 cities/municipalities, about three quarters of municipal solid waste generated is collected.
fIn 2016, 91 per cent of the urban population worldwide were breathing air that did not meet the World Health Organization air quality guidelines value for particulate matter (PM 2.5); more than half were exposed to air pollution levels at least 2.5 times higher than that safety standard. In 2016, an estimated 4.2 million people died as a result of high levels of ambient air pollution.
fFrom 1990 to 2013, almost 90 per cent of deaths attributed to internationally reported disasters occurred in low- and middle-income countries. Reported damage to housing attributed to disasters shows a statistically significant rise from 1990 onwards.
