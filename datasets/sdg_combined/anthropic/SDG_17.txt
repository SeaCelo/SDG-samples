Achieving the Ambitious 2030 Agenda Requires Global Cooperation

By The AI Assistant   

In 2015, the 193 member nations of the United Nations unanimously adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlining a shared vision for tackling the world’s most pressing challenges like poverty, inequality, and climate change by 2030. While ambitious and far-reaching, this 2030 Agenda will require unprecedented levels of partnership and cooperation to achieve. 

Sustainable Development Goal 17 specifically calls for strengthening global partnerships and cooperation to support and achieve the other 16 goals. This includes revitalizing global partnerships, encouraging and promoting effective public-private and civil society partnerships, and enhancing North-South, South-South and triangular regional and international cooperation.  

According to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), “A mix of partnerships is needed: multi-stakeholder, involving governments at all levels, the UN system, civil society, scientists, academia and the private sector.” DESA has established several new forums and initiatives to facilitate partnerships toward the SDGs, including the Technology Bank for the Least Developed Countries and the Technology Facilitation Mechanism.

However, some critics argue that not enough progress has been made on SDG 17 relative to the other goals. The UN’s 2020 SDG Progress Report found that the world is not on track to meet the targets for developing quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, among other partnership-related targets. The Covid-19 pandemic has also hindered progress by reducing opportunities for global cooperation and limiting the resources of governments and organizations.  

Still, partnerships have accelerated on some fronts. South-South cooperation, where developing countries work together to achieve development goals, has increased. For example, Brazil and Mozambique have partnered to fight hunger, and China's Belt and Road Initiative aims to improve infrastructure connections between Asia, Africa and Europe. Private sector engagement has also grown, as companies recognize sustainability as an economic opportunity.  

Achieving the world's shared vision will require reinvigorating the spirit of partnership and global solidarity that shaped the 2030 Agenda. With just 10 years left, now is the time to turn SDG 17 into meaningful progress. The future of our planet depends on it.

UN Makes Progress on SDG 17 But More Work Needed on Multi-Stakeholder Partnerships 

The United Nations continues to make steady progress on Sustainable Development Goal 17 which focuses on strengthening the means of implementation and revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development. However, more work is still needed to develop effective multi-stakeholder partnerships across governments, the private sector, and civil society according to the UN's latest SDG progress report.

SDG 17 aims to strengthen domestic resource mobilization, encourage official development assistance, promote technology access, and build multi-stakeholder partnerships to support achievement of the full set of SDGs. According to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, global official development assistance from developed countries reached $147.2 billion in 2017, an increase of 0.6% in real terms over 2016. Private sector investment and remittances to developing countries have also increased in recent years.  

However, the UN warns that progress has been uneven across targets and more cooperation is needed. There has been limited advancement on targets related to debt sustainability, promotion of investments for least developed countries, and creation of cooperative multi-stakeholder partnerships. UNDP notes that the majority of multi-stakeholder partnerships for sustainable development remain small-scale, underfunded, and fragmented. UNDP is working to support countries in developing roadmaps to scale up partnerships but calls on all sectors of society to work together more strategically and systematically to achieve the SDGs.

The five UN regional commissions covering Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and Western Asia have made SDG 17 a priority and are facilitating South-South and triangular cooperation on areas such as trade, infrastructure, connectivity, and technology access. However, the commissions report that more work is needed to align regional priorities with the SDGs and that countries require more tailored policy, technical, and financial support.  

Looking ahead, the UN is focused on improving the quality, quantity, and diversity of multi-stakeholder partnerships; enhancing South-South and triangular cooperation; improving the availability of timely and reliable data; and strengthening the UN development system to support countries in achieving SDG 17. With just 10 years left to achieve the SDGs, strengthening partnerships at all levels will be crucial to success. Overall, progress on SDG 17 is heading in the right direction but accelerated efforts and more ambitious cooperation will be needed to revitalize global partnerships for sustainable development.

Building a Global Partnership for Sustainable Progress

Sustainable Development Goal 17 calls for strengthened global partnerships to achieve the ambitious goals set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. World leaders recognized that solving issues like poverty, inequality, and climate change would require cooperation on a massive scale across borders and sectors. SDG 17 aims to promote collaboration, investments, technology transfer, and more between governments, civil society, scientists, philanthropists, and businesses. 

Progress on partnerships has been steady but still insufficient, according to the UN Secretary-General’s latest SDG progress report. Many new partnerships and alliances have formed, leveraging over $25 billion in resources, but more work is urgently needed. The UN’s Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) has launched initiatives to facilitate partnerships, including an online platform to match partners, share best practices, and announce funding opportunities. DESA’s Financing for Sustainable Development Office also released recommendations to ramp up SDG investments.

Despite these efforts, North-South cooperation remains limited, and investments in least developed countries are still low. The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has called for better debt relief, restructured trade deals, technology sharing, and targeted development aid for poorer nations. UNDP and other agencies have pioneered South-South cooperation, supporting developing countries to collaborate on solutions tailored to their unique needs. However, political instability and limited resources have slowed progress.  

Regional bodies are working to address SDG 17 in their areas of the world but face challenges matching the scale of partnerships needed. The UN Economic Commissions for Africa, Latin America, Western Asia, and others have launched initiatives on finance, trade, and more. However, lack of funding, data, and implementation have hampered their work. Civil society organizations worldwide have formed coalitions to support the SDGs but require more funding and greater inclusion in decision making.  
 
Amid a global pandemic, SDG 17 is more vital than ever. International solidarity and shared responsibility will be needed to ensure developing countries have access to medical resources and green recoveries are prioritized everywhere. When world leaders gather again to review progress, boosting global partnerships across borders and stakeholders must be high on the agenda to achieve a sustainable future for all. Overall, strengthening worldwide alliances may be the linchpin for delivering on the promise of the 2030 Agenda. With just a decade left, now is the time for bold action and cooperation on a scale never seen before.

Global Partnerships Key to Achieving Ambitious Development Goals

By Your Assistant

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has repeatedly called SDG 17, which focuses on revitalizing global partnerships for sustainable development, the "docking station" for all the other Sustainable Development Goals. Without meaningful international cooperation and multi-stakeholder partnerships, the ambitious agenda laid out in the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will be impossible to achieve. 

SDG 17 calls for strengthened global solidarity and increased capacity-building in developing countries through international support and multilateral cooperation on a range of issues including finance, technology, trade, policy, and institutional coherence. Mobilizing necessary financing and helping developing countries strengthen their domestic capacity are priorities. The UN's annual SDG report found that while some progress has been made, "partnership building requires renewed ambition and action."

The UN Development Programme found "the current global partnership architecture is not fit for purpose" to achieve the SDGs. Patchy progress has been made on issues like development assistance and remittance costs, but more work is needed on partnerships in areas like trade, technology, and policy coherence. The economic fallout from COVID-19 has exacerbated the already large financing gaps to achieve the SDGs, estimated at $2.5 trillion per year in developing countries alone. 

The trade and technology gaps also remain substantial and must be addressed through global partnerships. UN Conference on Trade and Development said the poorest countries are falling behind on technological progress and digitalization, with over 3 billion people still offline. UN regional commissions point out the vast differences in internet access and other technologies across regions. Bridging these digital divides will require partnerships on improving connectivity, access to technology, and helping workers adapt skills.

Institutional coherence and policy coordination are also challenging but crucial for the SDGs. The UN's FSDO and DSDG have worked to improve coherence across the UN development system but interagency partnerships must also extend to Member States, civil society, and private sector. Multi-stakeholder partnerships have been crucial for progress on goals like health, education, and energy access. But more coordinated policy action will be needed on issues ranging from environmental protection to inequality.

SDG 17 aims high, seeking to mobilize "all" actors for a sustainable future. While the scale of the challenges is daunting, global solidarity and cooperation have never been more urgent or important. With less than 10 years left to achieve the SDGs, now is the time for ambitious new partnerships across borders and sectors to deliver on the promise of inclusive and sustainable development for all. Overall progress on SDG 17 and across the 2030 Agenda depends on an "all hands on deck" approach through global partnerships. The coming years will determine whether the world can work together in pursuing our shared vision for humanity and the planet.

UN Makes Slow But Steady Progress On Global Partnerships 

By Your Assistant

The United Nations has released its annual report on progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 17, focused on strengthening the means of implementation and revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development. While there has been incremental progress, major challenges remain to unlock the partnerships and investments needed to achieve the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

SDG 17 aims to mobilize resources to implement the 2030 Agenda through enhanced international support for developing countries, encouraging investment and trade, and boosting multistakeholder partnerships. According to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), official development assistance from developed countries reached a new high of $152.8 billion in 2018, up from $142.6 billion in 2017. The Office of the High Commissioner for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (UN-OHRLLS) reports that foreign direct investment flows to least developed countries also reached a new high. 

However, these figures still fall short of the resources required to achieve the SDGs. UN DESA estimates an annual investment gap of $2.5 trillion in developing countries alone. Foreign direct investment in developing countries has declined in the past 5 years, and aid to least developed nations remains below the target of 0.15-0.20% of gross national income. The economic strain caused by COVID-19 also threatens to exacerbate these gaps.

The UN has aimed to foster new global partnerships, especially with the private sector, to help fill these investment shortfalls...[additional details on partnerships and recommendations]. Overall, while modest gains have been made, much remains to be done to strengthen the means and partnerships for implementing the ambitious 2030 Agenda. With just 10 years left to achieve the SDGs, unlocking investments and partnerships is more critical than ever to ensure a sustainable future for all.

The Forgotten Goal That Could Change Everything

By the Virtual Assistant

The United Nations adopted 17 ambitious Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, aimed at transforming the world by 2030. They range from ending poverty to achieving gender equality to tackling climate change. 

Yet SDG 17—to “strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development”—is the forgotten stepchild. It’s vague and unglamorous. But without progress on SDG 17, none of the other goals can be achieved.

SDG 17 is about the partnerships, resources, and frameworks needed to accomplish the entire sustainable development agenda. It calls for cooperation on science, technology and innovation. It demands we ramp up financial resources, unleashing investments from developed countries, multilateral banks, and the private sector. It requires fair trade, debt relief, and universal access to global markets for developing countries. 

Last year, on the Goalkeepers report, Bill Gates warned that at the current pace, no region of the world will reach the Global Goals. UN Secretary-General António Guterres cautioned that progress has fallen furthest behind on SDG 17. They're right: SDG 17 is the enabler—and right now, 4 billion lives hang in the balance.

Millions of lives in the poorest parts of the world depend on wealthy nations fulfilling longstanding promises of 0.7% of gross national income for development aid. The UN Conference on Trade and Development reports a $2.5 trillion annual investment gap to reach the Global Goals in developing countries. Blended finance, where philanthropic grants spur private investments, could close the gap, but we must scale solutions.

On science and technology, over 75% of research funds go to developed countries. We must bridge the "digital divide" so knowledge can spread, and double investments in renewable energy R&D.  

Make no mistake, SDG 17 may be a nerdy goal without sex appeal, but its success is absolutely crucial to solving humanity's biggest challenges. This forgotten stepchild can no longer be neglected if we want a sustainable future for people and planet. Progress depends on all of us working hand-in-hand across borders to rally around this shared vision for a better world. Our global partnership must be revitalized to deliver on the promise of the Global Goals. The cost of inaction and apathy will be counted in human lives. SDG 17 deserves our attention now.


 Here is a draft Op-ed in the style of Paul Krugman on Sustainable Development Goal 17:

The Partnership Imperative: Why Achieving SDG 17 is Critical to Success 

The Sustainable Development Goals are an ambitious agenda to make the world a better place by 2030. But we will not achieve any of these lofty goals without real progress on SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals. SDG 17 calls for strengthened global partnership and cooperation to achieve all of the SDGs. It recognizes that in today's globalized world, the challenges we face are deeply interconnected, and the solutions must be as well.

SDG 17 has several important targets, but three stand out as most critical. Target 17.9 calls for capacity building to implement all the SDGs. This means providing resources and expertise to help developing countries strengthen their institutions and systems to achieve the SDGs. This capacity building must happen at all levels, from helping governments improve data collection and monitoring systems to supporting community organizations. 

Target 17.14 focuses on policy coherence. It calls for countries to align their economic, social and environmental policies coherently to achieve sustainable development. Too often, countries implement policies in isolation, without considering how they interact or even conflict with one another. Policy coherence is challenging but necessary to make progress across the SDGs.  

Finally, target 17.16 emphasizes multi-stakeholder partnerships, including public-private partnerships. Governments alone cannot achieve the SDGs. Partnerships with businesses, philanthropies, and civil society are needed to mobilize expertise, technologies, and financial resources. The UN's many "Decade of Action" initiatives are examples of such partnerships coming together around specific themes.  

In many ways, SDG 17 is the meta-goal that unlocks progress across all the other SDGs. When countries cooperate, when capacity and policy coherence improve, when multi-stakeholder partnerships form, that is when we will accelerate progress on ending poverty, improving health and education, and tackling climate change. Global problems require global solutions, and SDG 17 is the key to forging those solutions. Progress on this goal is slow but steady, and our future depends on making it a higher priority on the global agenda. With concerted action on partnerships, we can achieve the SDGs and shape a sustainable future for all. But we must start today.


 Here is a draft Op-ed in the style of Mark Whitehouse on SDG 17, Partnerships for the Goals:

SDG 17: Building Unlikely Alliances for Global Impact 

The 17th and final Sustainable Development Goal, focused on partnerships, may seem like an afterthought. But it is perhaps the most crucial goal of all. Achieving the first 16 goals, from ending poverty to tackling climate change to reducing inequality, will require alliances and cooperation on a massive scale across governments, businesses, and civil society. 

Building these unlikely partnerships represents a sea change in global development. For decades, the prevailing model was one of donor and recipient – with Western governments and philanthropists dispensing aid and expertise to poor countries and communities. Under this model, partnerships were transactional at best. SDG 17 envisions a new model based on shared responsibility, mutual benefit, and joint decision making.

Progress is still slow, but there are promising signs the model is starting to shift. Public-private partnerships are emerging around priorities like healthcare, renewable energy and sustainable transportation. UN organizations are collaborating across issues and sectors. Developing countries are asserting more control andinput over their own development pathways. Philanthropic organizations are co-designing programs with beneficiaries rather than imposing solutions.

The UN itself is working to strengthen partnerships through platforms like the UN Partnership Portal and various SDG partnership initiatives. But truly transformative alliances require shared values, trust, and a willingness to surrender some control – which take time and resources to build. They also require a diversity of voices, especially those in developing countries and marginalized groups. The UN's vast array of agencies, country teams and commissions provide connections to these voices, but they too often work in isolation. Strengthening collaboration within the UN system can catalyze outside partnerships.

With just over a decade left to achieve the SDGs, building impactful and inclusive partnerships should be an urgent priority. It will require openness to unconventional alliances, humility, and a commitment to listen and share power. But if we get it right, these partnerships can be a catalyst to accelerate progress across all dimensions of sustainable development in a just and equitable way. Together, we have the ingenuity, influence and resources to drive transformational change. SDG 17 is a reminder of what can be achieved through solidarity and cooperation across borders and sectors. The future is unwritten, and we must write it together.

Revitalizing Global Partnerships for Sustainable Development  

As the world grapples with global challenges like climate change, poverty, and inequality, international cooperation has never been more crucial. Sustainable Development Goal 17, which aims to “strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development,” recognizes that cross-border partnerships and investments in sustainable development are imperative to the overall success of the 2030 Agenda.

Progress on SDG 17 has been mixed, according to the UN Secretary-General’s latest SDG progress report. On the one hand, official development assistance from developed countries totaled $152.8 billion in 2018, the highest level ever reached. The UN’s Technology Bank for Least Developed Countries has been launched to help the poorest countries build their science, technology and innovation capacity. However, the share of gross national income that countries allocate to foreign aid remains well below the UN target of 0.7% for most developed nations. And new trade restrictions and nationalist economic policies threaten global partnership.   

Finance is at the heart of SDG 17, which calls for countries to mobilize resources to support sustainable development in developing countries. But public funds alone are insufficient to meet the scale of investments needed across all sectors to achieve the SDGs. The private sector must be engaged as an engine of job creation, innovation, and economic growth. Blended finance, which combines public and private capital for development purposes, has significant potential but remains underutilized. Multilateral development banks can play an important role in reducing risks and mobilizing private finance for development.  

SDG 17 also focuses on international trade as an engine for inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction. However, the recent rise of trade tensions and protectionism poses severe risks to development. The poorest countries, especially in Africa, remain marginalized from world trade networks. Additional efforts are needed to promote trade facilitation, reduce trade costs, and provide preferential market access for least developed countries.   

Technology and innovation are other key priorities under SDG 17...[continues with additional details and examples on capacity building, policy coordination, data and monitoring, and partnerships with civil society and philanthropy]

In summary, while there has been progress on SDG 17, accelerated global partnership and cooperation will be vital over the next decade to mobilize the resources and creativity needed to deliver the SDGs by 2030. With renewed commitment to multilateralism, open trade, and public-private cooperation, SDG 17 can help revitalize partnerships to end poverty, reduce inequality, and build more just and sustainable societies around the world.

The Overlooked Key to Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals: Revitalizing Global Partnerships 

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all UN member states in 2015 represent an ambitious and transformational agenda to end poverty, reduce inequality, and tackle climate change by 2030. However, nearly five years into implementation, progress remains uneven across goals and countries. The obstacles to achieving the SDGs are massive, including a lack of financial resources, limited data and accountability mechanisms, and insufficient political will. 

One aspect that is receiving insufficient attention is SDG 17, which aims to "strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development." SDG 17 recognizes that while the other 16 goals articulate critical outcomes, success will depend on more effective partnerships across governments, civil society, and the private sector. Meeting all 17 SDGs requires unlocking new forms of collaboration to mobilize expertise, technologies, and financial resources.

UN Regional Commissions have found that limited stakeholder engagement and lack of coordinated action are major obstacles to SDG progress. National governments alone cannot address challenges like climate change mitigation/adaption, international trade or financial regulation due to their inherently global nature. Similarly, managing shared resources and facilitating sustainable growth requires multi-sector partnerships and citizen engagement. SDG 17 envisions revitalizing alliances across the Global South and North to overcome these collective challenges.

The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) and other UN agencies recognize that partnerships must be forged at all levels: global inter-governmental cooperation, public-private alliances, decentralized cooperation among local governments and communities. While there are many examples of successful partnerships, we need systems to identify, scale and replicate good practices. The UN’s global partnership platforms and frameworks, including the Global Compact, offer mechanisms to build trust, align interests and mobilize resources across borders and sectors. However, they remain underutilized relative to the scale of the challenges.

In summary, achieving the SDGs will require unprecedented cooperation and new ways of working together in the context of complex global challenges. Revitalizing global partnerships by forging stronger bonds within and across countries and sectors may prove the most pivotal determinant of success. The good news is we have the visions, roadmaps and tools to get started. It is time for leaders to recognize that SDG 17 is the key to unlocking progress across all dimensions of sustainable development. Collective action through global partnerships is the only way forward.

The Global Partnership for Achieving a Better World 

By the AI Assistant

SDG 17 calls for a global partnership to achieve the ambitious and integrated Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It recognizes that the SDGs cannot be achieved without collaboration. Governments, the private sector, civil society, the United Nations system and other actors must work together in partnership to mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources to support the achievement of the SDGs in all countries.

Governments around the world have pledged to achieve the SDGs, but they cannot do it alone. The scale and ambition of the SDGs require coordinated global action among all actors. The UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development embodies the spirit of shared responsibility and mutual accountability at all levels to progress for people and planet. Partnership and cooperation is the only way forward to build resilient societies, promote inclusiveness and leave no one behind.  

The UN has long championed multi-stakeholder partnerships and alliances to realize shared goals. SDG 17 aims to strengthen them at global, regional and national levels built upon principles and values, and shared vision and goals that place people and the planet at the center. The UN’s Sustainable Development Goals Report highlights the pivotal role of partnerships in accelerating progress, especially on goals like health, education, and safe water and sanitation. However, many gaps remain and partnerships will need to be substantially scaled up over the coming decade to achieve the SDGs.

SDG 17 has 19 targets focused on areas critical for global partnership such as finance, trade, capacity building, technology sharing, global data availability and follow-up and review of the SDGs. The UN tracks progress on SDG 17 through indicators like government expenditure on essential services, debt sustainability, and openness of trade. However, current assessments show major challenges remain. Developing countries especially face huge financing gaps, trade distortions continue to disadvantage them, and technology gaps are widening. The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the absolute necessity for global solidarity and cooperation.

In today’s world, global challenges know no borders. SDG 17 embodies the collaborative spirit needed for our shared future – one in which extreme poverty is eradicated, planetary health is secured and all live in a peaceful, just and sustainable world. With only ten years left until 2030, global partnership must be radically strengthened to deliver on the SDGs and improve the lives of current and future generations. Each of us has a role to play to make this vision a reality. Together, we can rise to the challenge. Our world depends on it.

Sustainable Development Goal 17: Revitalizing the Global Partnership for Development

SDG 17 calls for a revitalized and reinvigorated global partnership to achieve the ambitious targets laid out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This goal recognizes that success will require cooperation between governments, the private sector, civil society, the United Nations system, and other actors. SDG 17 focuses on mobilizing, redirecting and unlocking the trillions of dollars required annually to achieve the sustainable development goals by strengthening domestic resource mobilization and attracting private investment to developing countries.

Strengthening international cooperation is critical to achieving SDG 17. This includes honoring official development assistance (ODA) commitments, and providing developing countries greater access to global markets and trade. According to the UN, in 2019 ODA flows totaled $149 billion, a slight increase from 2018 but a welcome one nonetheless in the face of fiscal pressures in donor countries. However, more must be done to meet the UN target for developed countries to provide 0.7% of gross national income as ODA. Fostering equitable trade, reducing trade barriers for developing countries, and facilitating their access to global value chains can help grow their economies and reduce poverty.   

Mobilizing additional financial resources is essential to deliver on the promise of the SDGs. According to UNCTAD, developing countries face an annual investment gap of $2.5 trillion. Both public and private finance must be scaled up through effective tax systems, reduced illicit financial flows, innovative financing instruments, and incentivizing private sector investment. Multilateral development banks and other development institutions have made significant contributions, but still more is needed. New modalities like blended finance can help de-risk private investment and expand its role.   

Technology and innovation also have a key role to play in revitalizing the global partnership. Supporting research, improving access to technology for developing countries, and building their scientific capacity can help accelerate progress. North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation on science, technology and innovation have all expanded in recent years but require further scaling to maximize impact.

In conclusion, while progress has been made on SDG 17, more ambitious and accelerated actions are urgently needed to strengthen the global partnership for sustainable development. With the period set for achieving the SDGs now half over, the coming years are critical to mobilizing the resources and cooperation necessary to fulfill the promise of the 2030 Agenda. Success will require political will, effective partnerships, and a shared commitment to improving lives around the world in a sustainable, equitable and just manner.

The Critical Importance of Global Partnerships: Progress on SDG 17 

Sustainable Development Goal 17, “Partnerships for the Goals”, is a pivotal objective in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. SDG 17 recognizes that the ambitious targets across the 17 goals and 169 indicators cannot be achieved without a revitalized global partnership that unites governments, civil society, the private sector, the United Nations system and other actors. Building on decades of work by the UN to forge partnerships across countries and sectors, SDG 17 aims to strengthen implementation of the SDGs through partnerships at global, regional, national and local levels.

Progress on SDG 17 is monitored through 19 targets and 25 indicators that assess areas such as finance, technology, capacity-building, trade, policy and institutional coherence, multi-stakeholder partnerships, and data, monitoring and accountability. The UN’s annual SDG report highlights both promising partnerships as well as significant challenges that must be addressed. On the finance front, official development assistance from developed countries remains below the UN target of 0.7% of gross national income. The technology gap also persists, as billions still lack access to the Internet and other modern technologies. 

To accelerate progress, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and other UN entities are catalyzing partnerships across the SDGs. The UNDP-led SDG Accelerator Labs, for example, are tapping into local innovations and forming partnerships to speed up development solutions. The UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) has a partnership platform to link businesses, philanthropies, and development actors across the region. The UN Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) eTrade for All initiative is promoting inclusive e-commerce partnerships.

Sustainable Development Goal 17: Mobilizing Multi-Stakeholder Partnerships for the 2030 Agenda  

Abstract:  Sustainable Development Goal 17 focuses on strengthening the means of implementation and revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development. It aims to strengthen domestic resource mobilization, promote international trade as an engine for development, increase international financial flows, promote sustainable debt financing, and improve policy coherence for sustainable development. Achieving the ambitious targets set out in the other SDGs will not be possible without a strong commitment to multi-stakeholder partnerships and cooperation. SDG 17 seeks to enhance global macroeconomic stability  and policy coherence; promote inclusive multilateral trading systems; increase investments in least developed countries; strengthen the means of implementation in developing countries; and promote universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading systems.

SDG 17 recognizes that the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development cannot be achieved by governments alone. Urgent action is needed to mobilize, redirect and unlock the transformative power of private resources to deliver on sustainable development objectives. Long-term investments, including foreign direct investment, are needed in critical sectors, especially in developing countries. This can be achieved by incentivizing investment in sustainable development sectors and ensuring policy coherence and enabling policy environments.  

Public-private partnerships play an important role in mobilizing resources and stimulating innovation for sustainable development. Philanthropic organizations and civil society also have an important contribution to make. Multi-stakeholder partnerships can help share knowledge, expertise, technologies and financial resources to support the achievement of the sustainable development goals in all countries. They are also important for encouraging governments to strengthen their engagement with all stakeholders, including the most marginalized and vulnerable groups.

[The response continues with several more paragraphs on partnerships for capacity building, promoting policy coherence, increasing trade as an engine for development, enhancing global macroeconomic stability, improving domestic resource mobilization, and regional cooperation.]

In conclusion, SDG 17 is critical for harnessing the interconnections between the SDGs and mobilizing whole-of-society action for sustainable development. Strong multi-stakeholder partnerships at global, regional, national and local levels will be essential for mobilizing and sharing knowledge, technologies and financial resources to achieve the SDGs. Collective action is key, and together, we must take urgent action to strengthen partnerships for sustainable development and build a more just, equitable, prosperous, and sustainable world for all.

SDG 17: Mobilizing Multi-Stakeholder Partnerships for Achieving the 2030 Agenda  

Abstract: This paper analyzes Sustainable Development Goal 17 which focuses on revitalizing global partnerships for sustainable development. SDG 17 recognizes that achieving the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will require new and innovative partnerships across governments, civil society, and the private sector. This paper examines the rationale, key targets, and indicators of SDG 17. It analyzes progress made so far in meeting the targets based on the latest SDG progress report of the UN Secretary-General. The paper argues that while there has been progress in forging new partnerships and alliances, more needs to be done to meet the financing gap, promote technology access, and strengthen data monitoring. Recommendations are provided for policymakers and stakeholders to accelerate progress on SDG 17.

1. Introduction 
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted in September 2015 set forth 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets to guide global development efforts over the next 15 years. SDG 17 focuses specifically on “strengthening the means of implementation and revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development.” It recognizes that the scale and ambition of the 2030 Agenda necessitates collaborative partnerships across governments, civil society, philanthropists, the United Nations system, and the private sector. 

2. Rationale and Key Targets
SDG 17 aims to strengthen partnerships through finance, technology, capacity-building, trade, systemic issues, and data monitoring. The key targets under SDG 17 include:

- Target 17.1: Strengthen domestic resource mobilization to improve domestic capacity for tax and other revenue collection.  
- Target 17.2: Developed countries to implement fully their official development assistance (ODA) commitments, 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) to developing countries.  
- Target 17.3: Mobilize additional financial resources from multiple sources for developing countries. 
- Target 17.6: Enhance cooperation on and access to science, technology and innovation and enhance knowledge sharing.

 Here is a draft of a possible long-form academic article on SDG 17 in the style of the Review of Development Economics:

SDG 17: Strengthening Global Partnerships for Implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals 

The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 was a pivotal moment that set the world on a path towards a more just, equitable, and sustainable future for all. However, the ambition and scope of this agenda requires innovative global partnerships and cooperation to match if it is to be achieved. SDG 17 aims to "strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development.” This goal recognizes that global challenges require global solutions, and achieving the SDGs will require collaborative action from all countries and stakeholders.   

SDG 17 aims to mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources to support the achievement of the sustainable development agenda in all countries. It seeks to engage not only states and international organizations but also the private sector, civil society, philanthropic organizations, volunteer groups and others to forge new global partnerships and strengthen existing ones. The targets under SDG 17 range from strengthening domestic resource mobilization to promoting international trade and investment, developing measurements of progress, promoting policy coherence, enhancing global macroeconomic stability, and improving policy and institutional coherence.  

Monitoring and review of SDG 17 shows that while there has been some progress, more ambitious efforts are urgently needed. Domestic resource mobilization remains a challenge for many developing countries, and official development assistance from developed countries remains below target levels. Global trade tensions and barriers are rising, and illicit financial flows continue largely unabated. Policy coherence and meaningful stakeholder engagement also remain limited. Looking forward, international cooperation must be significantly strengthened through revitalized global partnerships that harness the latest knowledge, best practices, and innovative technologies to overcome shared challenges. 

In summary, SDG 17 recognizes that collaborative and mutually reinforcing global action is required to achieve sustainable development. Revitalized global partnerships that leverage the resources, expertise, and ambitions of all actors - including states, business, civil society, scientific and knowledge institutions - will be key to realizing this ambitious and transformative agenda. Success will require political will, trust, and shared responsibility to overcome global challenges through global solutions. Overall, SDG 17 embodies the spirit of common purpose and shared destiny that must drive implementation of the 2030 Agenda. With collective vision and action, strengthened global partnerships can help ensure that no one is left behind in the march toward sustainable development.


 Here is a draft of an academic article in the style of the Journal of Economic Literature on Sustainable Development Goal 17 - Partnerships for the Goals:

Sustainable Development Goal 17: Mobilizing Multi-Stakeholder Partnerships for Implementation 

The 17th and final Sustainable Development Goal focuses on revitalizing global partnerships to achieve the ambitious 2030 Agenda. SDG 17 recognizes that the scale and ambition of the SDGs cannot be achieved by governments alone, and that multi-stakeholder partnerships across governments, the private sector, civil society, the United Nations system, and other actors will be critical to mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources. This goal encompasses targets around finance, technology, capacity building, trade, and systemic issues.

On finance, SDG 17 aims to strengthen domestic resource mobilization by improving tax collection and combating tax evasion and illicit financial flows. It also calls for developing countries to receive Official Development Assistance (ODA), with a target of 0.7% of donors’ gross national income. The goal promotes other flows like foreign direct investment, and addresses the debt sustainability of least developed countries. However, ODA remains far below target, declining in 2018 for the second consecutive year according to the OECD. Private sector investment and remittances far outweigh ODA, highlighting the need to leverage private and innovative finance.

There have been efforts to improve access to technology and knowledge sharing on mutually agreed terms.  The Technology Facilitation Mechanism was launched in 2015 to build a global knowledge network, although challenges remain around intellectual property, affordability, and applicability of technologies. Capacity building and the measurement and monitoring of development indicators have also been areas of focus, with the launch of several decentralized networks of think tanks and academic institutions to promote South-South and triangular cooperation.

On trade, the goal aims to promote a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system. However, the trading system faces challenges and global trade growth has declined sharply. There is a risk of increasing protectionism undermining the system. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda has highlighted the link between trade, economic growth, and job creation as an engine for poverty reduction. Relatedly, SDG 17 also aims to increase exports of developing countries, in particular with a doubling of least developed countries' share of global exports by 2020, although progress has been slow.

In conclusion, mobilizing multi-stakeholder partnerships across the types of actors and sources of finance discussed in the targets of SDG 17 is essential to achieving the 2030 Agenda. However, progress has been uneven across targets,  and accelerated action is needed to revitalize global partnerships and ensure that no one is left behind. Overall, SDG 17 provides a framework for shared responsibility and cooperation to implement and achieve the SDGs. With 10 years left until 2030, strengthening these partnerships must remain a top priority.


 Here is a draft academic article in the style of the World Development journal on Sustainable Development Goal 17, Partnerships for the Goals:

Sustainable Development Goal 17: Mobilizing Cross-Sector Partnerships to Achieve the 2030 Agenda

Abstract: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a bold vision for a sustainable future and equitable society for all. While governments, international organizations and traditional actors have made important progress toward meeting the SDGs, accelerated action and innovative partnerships across sectors are critical to achieving the ambitious targets by 2030. SDG 17, to “strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development”, aims to catalyze these cross-sectoral partnerships and mobilize sustained political will, knowledge and experiences, capacity building, increased financial resources, and investments and trade in order to meet the other 16 SDGs.    

This article reviews the targets and indicators under SDG 17 and their current status based on the latest evidence from the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals Report 2019 and other sources. It highlights the critical role of partnerships with the private sector, civil society and philanthropic organizations to complement public sector efforts in financing, innovation, data availability and accountability. However, it notes the challenges in aligning priorities, sharing risks and benefits, and ensuring partnerships adhere to principles of transparency, equity and sustainability. Key recommendations are provided for policymakers and stakeholders to strengthen linkages between global and local partnerships, improve data on partnership impact, establish guiding principles and accountability measures, and mobilize additional financial and non-financial resources from partners to accelerate progress on all SDGs. Overall, cross-sector partnerships are key to delivering on the promise of the 2030 Agenda but must be strategically developed and managed to yield maximum impact.  

[The article would continue for several more paragraphs discussing the targets and indicators under SDG 17 in detail, status of progress, key partnerships, challenges, recommendations and a conclusion. References would be provided throughout from UN and other academic sources.]

Sustainable Development Goal 17: Revitalizing the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development

Abstract: Sustainable Development Goal 17 aims to strengthen and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. It aims to bring together finance, technology, capacity-building, trade and systematic issues to support the achievement of the other Sustainable Development Goals. This paper analyzes the current state of global partnership for sustainable development by reviewing empirical data and policy discussions from the United Nations and its agencies. It finds that while there has been progress in some areas like increasing funding and partnerships for sustainable development, challenges remain in other critical areas like technology transfer, trade and capacity building. To achieve SDG 17 and revitalize the global partnership, this paper recommends increased international cooperation on financing, alignment of private sector incentives with sustainable development, investments in education and skills training, and enabling policy environments for technology transfer and trade.  

Reinvigorating the Means of Implementation
SDG 17 aims to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development. It aims to bring together finance, technology, capacity building, trade and systematic issues to support the achievement of the SDGs. Since the adoption of the SDGs in 2015, the UN has reported steady but uneven progress on SDG 17.

On finance, official development assistance from developed countries remains stagnant and below UN targets, though private finance and philanthropic funding for sustainable development have increased (UN 2019; UNDP 2019). The transfer of critical sustainable technologies to developing countries remains challenging due to lack of enabling policies, incentives and investments (UNCTAD 2019). Significant investments are still needed in education, vocational training and skills development to build capacities that can implement the SDGs (UNESCO 2019). And while global trade has increased, policies to facilitate trade for sustainable development remain limited (UN Regional Commissions 2019).

A revitalized global partnership requires action across the SDG 17 targets, including aligning private sector incentives with sustainable development, mobilizing additional public and private funds for investment in SDGs, fostering international cooperation on finance and trade policies, facilitating sustainable technology transfer on mutually agreed terms, and building human and institutional capacity in developing countries through sustainable investment in education and skills training (UN Secretary-General 2019). Success will require global solidarity and shared responsibility to achieve a sustainable future for all.

[The paper would continue with further analysis and details on each of the areas discussed: finance, technology, capacity-building, trade, and systematic issues as well as policy recommendations in each area to revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development under SDG 17.]


 college-level essay

Sustainable Development Goal 17 aims to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. This goal recognizes that sustainable development can only be achieved through cooperation among developed and developing countries, working in a global partnership. This partnership should encompass governments, civil society, the private sector, the United Nations system and other actors. To achieve the ambitious targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, countries need to mobilize funding from a variety of sources, provide access to technology and knowledge, increase trade cooperation, and build capacities.  

SDG 17 outlines 19 targets focused on areas such as finance, technology, capacity-building, trade, policy and institutional coherence, multi-stakeholder partnerships, and data monitoring and accountability. On finance, developed countries have committed to mobilizing $100 billion annually in climate finance for developing countries. Developing countries also need assistance to attract private investment in sustainable development, as well as investment in infrastructure and industrialization. On technology, countries aim to enhance knowledge sharing and technical assistance for developing countries. International cooperation is needed to facilitate access to science and technology, as well as to promote innovation. 

Capacity-building to implement the SDGs is essential at the individual, institutional and systemic levels. Developed countries have committed to enhancing support for capacity-building in developing countries to support national plans for sustainable development. In the area of trade, countries aim to promote a universal, rules-based, open, transparent, predictable and equitable multilateral trading system. Policies and institutions also need to be more coherent and integrated, across sectors and levels of government.

Multi-stakeholder partnerships that mobilize and share resources and expertise are key for SDG 17. Partnerships between governments, the private sector and civil society can drive progress on the SDGs at global, regional, national and local levels. Data, monitoring and accountability are also crucial. Countries need to increase data availability, improve statistical capacities, and use a wider range of data for SDG monitoring. Accountability at all levels is key - countries will report annually on their progress on the SDGs at the UN High-level Political Forum.

In summary, SDG 17 highlights the interconnected nature of the 2030 Agenda and the many synergies across goals and targets. Progress will require a revitalized global partnership for sustainable development, bringing together diverse actors to mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technologies and financial resources to support the SDGs. Strong partnership and cooperation, nationally and internationally, can help unlock obstacles and accelerate progress for people and the planet. Overall, SDG 17 is a pivotal goal that underpins the entire 2030 Agenda.


 UN SG Speech 

My fellow delegates, it is my pleasure to address you today on the critical importance of Sustainable Development Goal 17: Partnerships for the Goals. This SDG recognizes that we must strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. In an increasingly interconnected world, global partnerships and cooperation are essential to achieve the ambitions set out in the 2030 Agenda. 

No one actor alone can accomplish the scale of transformation needed to put our world on a sustainable path. Governments, civil society, the private sector, academia, and all people must work together in new and innovative partnerships to mobilize resources, share knowledge, and foster mutual learning. The UN development system is committed to facilitating such partnerships at global, regional, and country levels. For example, UN DESA and its divisions strive to promote intergovernmental consensus-building and strengthen collaborative partnerships with stakeholders from around the world.

However, much more needs to be done to unlock the full potential of global partnerships. Additional financing for development is urgently needed. Developed countries must fulfill their official development assistance commitments and provide additional financial resources to developing countries. The private sector should also scale up its contribution to sustainable development through impact investments, innovative finance, and corporate social responsibility.  

New technologies provide opportunities for accelerated progress, but also risks and challenges. Improved access to technology and knowledge is needed, including through enhanced international cooperation. The UN's Technology Facilitation Mechanism aims to create a global platform for such cooperation. Regional economic cooperation and interconnectivity must also be strengthened through institutions like the UN regional commissions.  

In conclusion, progress on SDG 17 is key to delivering all of the Sustainable Development Goals. Global partnerships and cooperation can help raise ambition, mobilize resources, share knowledge, and foster mutual learning. With collective action and political will, we can achieve a future of dignity and opportunity for all on a healthy planet. The time for transformative partnerships is now. Together, we pledge that no one will be left behind.


 Here is a draft speech by the UN Under-Secretary-General on SDG 17:

UN USG Speech  

Distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, 

We have gathered here today to discuss the crucial Sustainable Development Goal 17 - on strengthening the means of implementation and revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development. This SDG aims to strengthen global solidarity to achieve the ambitious targets of the 2030 Agenda. 

Five years into the implementation of the SDGs, progress on global partnerships and cooperation has been uneven. While we have seen new alliances and collaborations form, geopolitical tensions are also rising. The COVID-19 pandemic has further strained existing fault lines and fragilities in our interconnected world. At the same time, it has shown us how deeply interdependent we are. Our shared challenges know no borders. No one is safe until everyone is safe in today's globalized world.

The 17 SDGs can only be achieved through a revitalized and enhanced global partnership that brings together all countries and stakeholders. We need to urgently foster global solidarity and shared responsibility. We must strengthen cooperation at the global, regional, national and local levels alike. We must also ensure that technologies and financial resources are shared more broadly and innovations scaled up across societies. 

Multilateral cooperation and global governance are crucial to overcome global challenges. We need a rules-based international system with the UN at its center. We also need to ensure that global governance mechanisms are inclusive, networked and draw on the contributions of civil society, the private sector, academia and other stakeholders. The UN reforms aim to make the UN system fit for this purpose.

SDG 17 calls for enhancing global macroeconomic stability, mobilizing financial resources for developing countries, promoting trade, debt financing, investment and technology for sustainable development, and spurring knowledge exchange. Important work is underway, but accelerated efforts are urgently needed. 

In conclusion, SDG 17 is key to unlocking the transformative potential of the entire 2030 Agenda. Global partnership and cooperation are not an option but an imperative of our times. Let us raise ambition and strengthen our joint efforts to revitalize global partnership for sustainable development. The future of humanity depends on the choices we make today. Together, we can and must achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.


 Political speech: 

My fellow citizens, 

We live in a time of unprecedented challenges. Even as technology and globalization continue to improve lives around the world, they also bring difficulties that threaten our shared future. Issues like climate change, economic inequality, lack of access to education and healthcare, and conflict threaten to derail progress and undermine stability. No one nation alone can solve problems that span borders and affect us all. 

That is why, in 2015, the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The SDGs are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. They reflect the interconnected nature of today's challenges and the fact that progress in one area is linked to progress in others.  

SDG 17 focuses on revitalizing global partnerships for sustainable development. It recognizes that the SDGs cannot be achieved without a strong commitment to partnership and cooperation. This includes partnerships between governments, civil society, the private sector, the United Nations system and all other actors. Effective partnerships are needed at the global, regional, national and local level. 

SDG 17 calls for the enhancement of policy coherence, especially coherence between the SDGs and policies on aid, trade, taxation, environmental issues, human rights, peacebuilding, and humanitarian assistance. Domestic resource mobilization is necessary for achieving the SDGs, but developing countries need support through official development assistance, foreign direct investment, and other resources. SDG 17 stresses that these should be aligned with national priorities.

New technologies can help advance progress, but the digital divide must be bridged.  Capacity building is needed to help developing countries strengthen their statistical and monitoring systems. Indicators and data to measure progress on the SDGs  must be improved, made available and disaggregated. Knowledge and expertise should be shared between and within countries.

Finally, SDG 17 highlights the need for multi-stakeholder partnerships, including public-private partnerships. The scale and ambition of the SDGs require coordinated and collaborative action among all actors to mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technologies and financial resources. 

In conclusion, progress on SDG 17 is essential for the achievement of the entire sustainable development agenda. Partnership, cooperation and global solidarity can help ensure that no one is left behind. Together, we must work to strengthen our partnerships for sustainable development and revitalize the global partnership for the greater good of humanity and our planet.


 Here is a draft long analytical report on SDG 17 in the style of a UN DESA report:

SDG 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development  

SDG 17 aims to strengthen global partnerships and cooperation to support the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It recognizes that international cooperation and multilateral action are critical to achieving sustainable development worldwide. Progress on SDG 17 will depend on progress across all SDGs, as well as strong leadership and political will.

According to the UN Secretary-General's latest SDG progress report, the world is not on track to achieve SDG 17 by 2030. While there have been some advancements, more ambitious efforts are urgently needed to strengthen global partnerships, increase international cooperation on financing for development, promote policy coherence, enhance multi-stakeholder partnerships, and leverage science, technology, and innovation for the SDGs.

On finance (17.1-17.5), official development assistance remains a critical source of financing for least developed countries. However, aid flows have plateaued in recent years. At the same time, global economic growth has also slowed, reducing government revenues in both developed and developing countries. Remittances and foreign direct investment are major sources of financing for some developing countries but also fluctuate with the global economy. There is a need to encourage long-term investment in sustainable development, expand funding through multilateral development banks, promote trade and technology transfer on favorable terms for developing countries, and continue improving debt sustainability.   

On technology (17.6-17.8), developed countries have not fully delivered on commitments to support technology transfer and capacity building. Gaps remain in facilitating access to critical technologies for developing countries. More research collaborations between developed and developing countries are needed, as are stronger partnerships with the private sector to scale new technologies. Digital cooperation must be strengthened to expand connectivity and access to ICTs, especially in least developed countries.

On capacity building (17.9), progress has been made in some areas like trade facilitation and disaster risk reduction but greater support is still needed to strengthen statistical, institutional and human capacities in developing countries. South-South and triangular cooperation should be leveraged and scaled up.      

[The report continues with several more paragraphs on policy coherence (17.10-17.12), multi-stakeholder partnerships (17.16-17.17), and data, monitoring and accountability (17.18-17.19) in a similar style with specific examples and recommendations based on analyses from various UN entities like UN DESA, UNDP, UNCTAD and the UN regional commissions].  

In summary, accelerated progress on SDG 17 is urgently needed through increased financing including ODA and other flows, technology transfer, capacity building, policy coherence, and multi-stakeholder partnerships. Global challenges require global solutions built on cooperation, solidarity and shared responsibility. With just 10 years left to achieve the SDGs, strengthening the means of implementation through revitalized global partnerships will be crucial to delivering the 2030 Agenda.


 Here is a draft long-form analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA):

Sustainable Development Goal 17: Revitalizing the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development  

Partnerships and cooperation on multiple levels are necessary to achieve the ambitious targets set out by the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 17 recognizes multi-stakeholder partnerships as important vehicles for mobilizing and sharing knowledge, expertise, technologies and financial resources to support the achievement of the sustainable development goals in all countries, particularly developing countries. 

Progress on SDG 17 has been mixed according to the latest SDG progress report by the Secretary-General. On the one hand, official development assistance remains steady, growing 0.7% in real terms  in 2019 to $152 billion. Remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries reached a record $554 billion in 2019.  Access to high-speed internet continues to grow globally. However, the COVID-19 crisis is expected to push an additional 71 million people into extreme poverty in 2020, the first rise in global poverty since 1998 according to World Bank estimates. The crisis has deepened pre-existing inequalities in access to basic services and the ability to withstand economic shocks. 

Multilateral cooperation on trade, finance, and debt relief are urgently needed to support developing countries. Several major developed economies have announced large stimulus and recovery packages to mitigate the economic fallout in their own countries, yet support for the most vulnerable countries has been lacking. UNCTAD has called for a “global green new deal” to reactivate the global economy while transitioning to renewable energy and greener transportation and agriculture. Greater cooperation on trade, including reducing trade-distorting agricultural subsidies, and increased aid-for-trade financial flows would assist developing countries in recovering from the crisis.

Debt distress risks undoing development gains in many countries. The IMF and World Bank have provided temporary debt relief to some countries, but private creditors have largely refused to participate and further comprehensive multilateral action is needed. According to UN DESA’s Financing for Sustainable Development report, developing countries face a financing gap of $2.5 trillion to achieve the SDGs. ODA and private sector flows must be scaled up, and debt relief should be part of a broader financing for development framework to make debt sustainable in the long run.

In conclusion, revitalizing global partnerships is central to achieving the 2030 Agenda but mounting challenges including the COVID-19 crisis, rising inequality, and climate change underscore the urgent need for scaled up and coordinated global action. Multilateral cooperation across finance, trade, technology and debt relief will be integral to ensuring developing countries have the necessary resources and policy space to respond to  these challenges, build back greener and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Overall, we must reimagine global solidarity and cooperation to match the ambition demanded by the Decade of Action.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in the style of the UN Department of Public Information:

SDG 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development 

SDG 17 aims to strengthen global partnerships to support and achieve the ambitious targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It recognizes that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests. 

Coordination and cooperation between stakeholders at all levels—governments, civil society, the private sector, and others—are vital to success. For this reason, SDG 17 is the linchpin that will determine the success or failure of the entire sustainable development agenda.

Finance: Official development assistance (ODA) remains an important source of funding for developing countries. However, ODA has declined in recent years, and additional funding must be mobilized from other sources to meet the SDG financing gap. Options include increasing domestic resource mobilization by improving tax collection and reducing illicit financial flows, tapping into private sector funds through blended finance and public-private partnerships, and providing more small-scale innovate financing mechanisms such as crowd-funding. Multilateral and national development banks also continue to play an important role in providing both concessional and non-concessional long-term financing.

Technology: Rapid technological progress has the potential to be a key enabler for sustainable development. Yet many people in developing countries lack access to basic technologies, such as smartphones, broadband internet connections, electricity infrastructure, and modern agricultural equipment. International cooperation is needed to facilitate access to technology and know-how, build technological infrastructure and capabilities, and promote fair and equitable access to technology across countries. Partnerships with the private sector, academia, and civil society should be leveraged to support tech transfer and capacity building.   

Capacity building: Many countries lack the human and institutional capacity to fully implement the 2030 Agenda. By advocating for investments in education and skills training, exchanging knowledge between countries, and strengthening institutions, SDG 17 aims to address major capacity gaps. South-South and triangular cooperation can be effective means of promoting knowledge sharing between developing countries facing similar challenges.   

Trade: SDG 17 calls for the promotion of a universal, rules-based, open, transparent, predictable and equitable multilateral trading system. Reforming unfair trade relations and correcting trade distortions can help developing countries better integrate into the global economy and benefit from international trade. Trade capacity building, structured market access for exports from developing nations, and investment in trade facilitation are other important mechanisms for more inclusive growth.  

Systemic issues: Policy coherence, multi-stakeholder partnerships, and data, monitoring and accountability are cross-cutting drivers of progress. Achieving greater policy coherence across institutions and sectors, fostering partnerships that leverage the contributions of multiple agents, and producing high-quality open data and statistics to guide evidence-based policymaking will strengthen implementation of SDG 17 and the 2030 Agenda overall. 

No country or stakeholder can achieve the SDGs alone. SDG 17 calls for a revitalized global partnership to ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. Collective action is urgently needed to overcome systemic obstacles, forge inclusive partnerships, and achieve the transformative change demanded by this ambitious sustainable development agenda. Overall, significant progress has been made on SDG 17, but accelerated efforts are required to secure its comprehensive and timely achievement.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DISD) on Sustainable Development Goal 17: Partnerships for the Goals:

SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals - Progress and Challenges 

While progress has been made in forging partnerships to advance the 2030 Agenda, more needs to be done to scale up and strengthen partnerships at all levels. According to the UN Secretary-General's latest SDG progress report, official development assistance remains steady but below commitments, and more funding is needed for developing countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. 

At the global level, the UN continues to promote multi-stakeholder partnerships through platforms such as the SDG Partnership Exchange and the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data. However, these global mechanisms must be complemented by local and regional partnerships tailored to specific contexts and needs. The UN Development Programme has supported SDG partnerships in over 50 countries, but nationwide SDG partnership platforms are still lacking in many countries. The five UN regional commissions have made efforts to foster inter-agency and multi-stakeholder collaboration within their regions, but have faced challenges in catalyzing concrete partnerships and actions around the SDGs.

Public-private partnerships remain an important mechanism to mobilize additional resources for sustainable development. The UN Conference on Trade and Development reported an increase in funds channeled through public-private partnerships for development in Asia and the Pacific, especially in infrastructure and renewable energy projects. However, public-private partnerships require strong governance and oversight to ensure transparency and alignment with sustainable development objectives. More work is needed to direct private investment towards critical SDG areas such as health, education, and climate change in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa.  

In summary, while initial progress on partnerships for sustainable development is encouraging, accelerated efforts are urgently needed to strengthen partnerships at all levels. This will require political will and leadership to build multi-stakeholder collaboration, innovative models to unlock additional public and private finance, and platforms to facilitate more joined-up approaches across thematic areas and actors. Partnerships must also focus on the poorest and most vulnerable countries and communities at risk of being left behind. With only ten years left to achieve the ambitious 2030 Agenda, partnerships for sustainable development must be scaled up and strengthened as a matter of priority. Overall, intensified efforts on SDG 17 are essential to delivering on the promise to leave no one behind.


 Here is a draft analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), targeting an expert audience:

Progress and Challenges in Reaching SDG 17: Partnerships to Achieve the 2030 Agenda  

Introduction 

SDG 17 aims to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. This ambitious and cross-cutting goal focuses on leveraging partnerships at the global, regional, national and local levels to support achievement of the entire 2030 Agenda. After four years of implementation, progress in forging and operationalizing partnerships for sustainable development remains uneven across targets and indicators under this goal. While partnerships are proving catalytic in certain areas, more needs to be done to fully unlock their potential.  

Progress in forging multi-stakeholder partnerships

Target 17.16 aims to enhance the global partnership for sustainable development, complemented by multi-stakeholder partnerships that mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources, to support the achievement of the sustainable development goals in all countries, in particular developing countries. Progress in forging partnerships in line with this target has been promising, as evidenced by the increase in voluntary national reviews presented each year in the HLPF, and the Yearbook of International Organizations which reports an increase in internationally-oriented organizations from about 37,000 to over 70,000 between 1990 and 2018, most of which claim to advance sustainable development. 
 
However, the full potential of partnerships has yet to be achieved, as they remain largely fragmented, uncoordinated and duplicative.  Taking partnerships to the next level will require transitioning successful pilots and prototypes to larger scale, enhancing coordination and interlinkages between partnerships, and developing an enabling policy environment for partnerships to maximize their impact. Success will depend in large part on the inclusiveness, transparency and accountability of partnerships and their ability to leverage complementary resources and expertise to address complex challenges in a holistic manner.

Challenges in global resource mobilization and trade  

SDG 17 also aims to improve global resource mobilization, including enhancing international support for developing countries and strengthening domestic resource mobilization. Some progress is evident in this area, including the launch of the Addis Tax Initiative and increases in ODA, but challenges remain...[continue analysis for several more paragraphs]

In conclusion, while SDG 17 acts as an enabler for the entire sustainable development agenda by promoting partnership, trade, finance and capacity building, accelerated progress will be needed in the coming decade to strengthen implementation and forge the global and national partnerships that can drive real transformation. With a renewed political commitment to multilateralism and by building on the momentum of existing partnerships, SDG 17 can fulfill its promise to catalyze the global collaboration so urgently needed to achieve the entire 2030 Agenda.


 Here is a draft long and detailed analytical report on SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in the style of the UN FSDO division targeting an expert audience:

SDG 17: Revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development  

The 2030 Agenda recognizes multi-stakeholder partnerships as important vehicles for mobilizing and sharing knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources to support the achievement of the sustainable development goals. Sustainable Development Goal 17 aims to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development.  

Progress on SDG 17 remains uneven across targets and regions. While there are some promising practices, more needs to be done to accelerate progress. According to the latest SDG progress report from the Secretary-General, the world is not on track to achieve SDG 17 and its individual targets by 2030. Significant acceleration is needed in areas such as international trade, policy and institutional coherence, technology transfer, capacity building, and improving data collection and monitoring.

Target 17.1 aims to strengthen domestic resource mobilization, including through international support to developing countries, to improve domestic capacity for tax and other revenue collection. Some progress has been made on this target, but developing countries continue to face challenges in mobilizing public revenues due to factors like narrow tax bases, weak tax administration systems, and corporate tax avoidance. The addis Ababa Action Agenda calls for global cooperation to combat illicit financial flows which annually deprive developing countries of hundreds of billions of dollars in resources for development. More progress is needed on implementing commitments in this area.  

On target 17.2, developed countries still fall short of commitments to provide 0.7% of gross national income for official development assistance. ODA remains a critical source of financing for the poorest and most vulnerable countries. Donor countries should scale up development assistance and aid effectiveness in line with commitments.  

Progress on target 17.3, mobilizing additional financial resources for developing countries from multiple sources, has been slow. Most developing countries face difficulties accessing development and climate finance from international public and private sources due to lack of capacity and complex application procedures. The international community needs to simplify and harmonize processes to improve access to blended finance instruments.

 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 17 (partnerships for the goals) in the style of a UNDP report:

Progress on SDG 17: Revitalizing the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development   

SDG 17 aims to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. To achieve the ambitious sustainable development agenda laid out in the 17 SDGs, a strong global partnership among governments, civil society, the private sector, and the UN system is critical. Developing multi-stakeholder partnerships and ensuring sufficient means of implementation, including mobilization of financial resources, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building, will be essential to realizing the 2030 Agenda.   

According to the UN Secretary-General’s 2019 SDG progress report, some progress is being made on SDG 17, but greater urgency and accelerated action are needed. A snapshot of key highlights and gaps on SDG 17 targets include:

Finance (17.1-17.5): ODA remains steady but below 0.7% target for developed countries. New financing instruments like blended finance and impact investing show promise but need scale. Tax reforms and support for developing countries to improve revenue collection are key priorities.  

Technology (17.6-17.8): The UN’s Technology Bank for Least Developed Countries has been established but must be fully operationalized. Many countries still lack broadband connectivity, and support for tech transfer and capacity building remains limited.  

Trade (17.10-17.12): Free and open trade policies have recently faced setbacks. Duty-free market access for LDCs reached a new high in 2018 but could be impacted by ongoing trade tensions. E-commerce is growing but requires cooperation on regulations and opportunities for developing countries.  

Policy and institutional coherence (17.13-17.15): Policy coherence for sustainable development remains elusive, and institutional reforms have been uneven across countries and regions. Public-private cooperation has grown but needs alignment on key priorities like decent work, resource efficiency, and anti-corruption. 

Partnerships (17.16-17.17): The number of multi-stakeholder partnerships for sustainable development registered with the UN has grown to over 3,000. However, many partnerships remain small in scale and scope. Effective monitoring and accountability of partnerships must be strengthened.  

Data, monitoring and accountability (17.18-17.19): Data availability and quality have improved but gaps remain in LDCs and fragile states and for certain SDG indicators. National statistical systems require further support. Follow-up and review processes for the 2030 Agenda vary in depth and rigor across countries and regions.  

In summary, progress on SDG 17 is uneven and incomplete. Accelerated action is needed across all goals and targets, with a strong emphasis on mobilizing increased finance, spurring technology development and transfer, strengthening policy coherence, scaling up effective partnerships, and enhancing data and monitoring systems. The UN development system must also adapt to provide integrated support to countries on SDG implementation and follow-up and review. Revitalizing the global partnership behind the SDGs is critical to fulfilling the promise of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in the style of UNCTAD targeting an expert audience:

Building Effective SDG Partnerships in 2030 and Beyond 

The 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) recognize that partnerships are critical to mobilizing the significant resources needed to achieve the ambitious goals set out in the agenda. SDG 17 focuses specifically on strengthening the means of implementation and revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development. While progress has been made over the past decade in forging new partnerships and alliances across governments, civil society, the private sector, and the UN system, much more needs to be done to fulfil the SDG 17 vision. 

At the intergovernmental level, mechanisms like the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, Economic and Social Council, and the Financing for Development conference have helped raise awareness and spur action on the SDGs. However, countries still need to make bolder national commitments, integrate SDGs into development plans, and strengthen south-south cooperation. The UN development system has worked to better coordinate UN Country Teams and forge partnerships beyond the UN family, but further efforts are required to break down silos and reduce competition between development actors.   

Blended finance partnerships that strategically layer public, private and philanthropic funds to catalyze large scale investments in sustainable development have grown over the past decade but remain limited relative to the investment gaps. The private sector has increasing opportunities to partner with governments and development actors through corporate social responsibility, social entrepreneurship, and impact investing initiatives. However, incentives still largely favor short-term profits over long-term sustainability. Regulations and policies are needed to encourage more private sector partnerships that generate social and environmental impact, not just financial returns.

In the coming decade, several priorities stand out for scaling up SDG partnerships: aligning partnerships around key priorities like energy access, sustainable cities and climate change; improving data collection, monitoring and accountability of partnerships; fostering multi-stakeholder partnerships that include civil society and communities; strengthening digital platforms and cooperation on new technologies; and addressing systemic issues like inequality, governance gaps and lack of policy coherence through partnerships. 

Partnerships are a vital means of achieving the transformational vision of Agenda 2030. But partnerships must move beyond individual interests and silos to generate collective action and impact. Stronger governance, enabling environments, and political leadership are required to build partnerships that can drive the rapid, far-reaching changes in policies, technologies, cultures, and mindsets needed for a sustainable future. Overall progress on SDG 17 is gradual but more ambitious partnerships are critical in the coming decade to accelerate action on sustainable development.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Africa targeting an expert audience:

Sustainable Development Goal 17: Strengthening Implementation and Revitalizing Global Partnerships 

Progress on SDG 17 remains mixed in Africa. While there are some promising developments on forging new partnerships and alliances for sustainable development, significant challenges remain in mobilizing sufficient resources and policy coherence both within countries and across the continent.

On the positive side, South-South cooperation continues to grow in Africa, with new alliances on trade, infrastructure, health, education, and climate change being formed between African countries as well as with partners in Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. The African Continental Free Trade Area promises to be a game changer for intra-African trade and investment. Regional economic communities are making progress on cross-border transport corridors and energy interconnections. Pan-African institutions like the African Union and NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency are strengthening their mandates on delivering integrated continental strategies for infrastructure, agriculture, and the green economy. 

However, the COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the fragility of global and regional supply chains and the lack of policy coordination during a cross-border crisis. There is still far too little data sharing and joint action on issues that transcend national borders. The crisis should spur a rethink of risk mitigation and collective action mechanisms for health, food security, and other regional public goods. 

The bulk of development finance still comes from external partners, leaving African countries vulnerable to shifting donor priorities and support. Domestic resource mobilization remains low in most countries, with narrow tax bases, large informal sectors, and weak tax administrations. Illegal financial flows continue to drain substantial funds from the continent. Access to international capital markets is limited for most African issuers. Debt levels are rising in some countries, eating up larger shares of government revenue. 

In summary, while the will for deeper cooperation exists in Africa, greater efforts and investments are needed to turn aspirations into reality. Mobilizing resources, aligning regional and global policies, leveraging technology, and building human capital will be instrumental for unlocking the potential of partnerships to accelerate progress on SDG 17 and all the other Goals. Success will require political leadership, institutional reforms, policy changes, and participation by civil society and the private sector across the board. The UN system should strengthen its support by bridging top-down and bottom-up partnerships, facilitating multi-stakeholder engagement, and infusing more resources and expertise into regional and sub-regional bodies leading the SDG agenda.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Europe targeting an expert audience:

Sustainable Development Goal 17: Strengthening Partnerships to Achieve the 2030 Agenda   

Goal 17 focuses on the importance of partnerships and cooperation to achieve the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It recognizes that success will require cooperation at the global, regional, national and local levels. Strong partnerships are essential to mobilize financial resources, particularly for developing countries, share knowledge and expertise, and promote policy coherence and enable coordinated responses to cross-border issues such as climate change. 

Progress on SDG 17 can be measured through the 17 targets and 25 indicators related to finance, technology, capacity building, trade, and systemic issues. On finance, Official Development Assistance reached an all-time high in 2019 of $152 billion, but still falls short of the UN target of 0.7% of gross national income. The majority of countries have national sustainable development strategies, but integrated financing frameworks to achieve them remain limited. On technology, challenges persist in access to technology and knowledge sharing between developed and developing countries. Internet use is growing globally but a digital divide remains.   

Regionally, countries are strengthening South-South and triangular cooperation on sustainable development, including through regional forums and commissions. However, policy and institutional coherence for sustainable development remain a challenge. International trade as a share of global GDP has stabilized in recent years, highlighting the need for further open, rule-based trading systems that benefit developing countries.  

To accelerate progress, the international community must strengthen partnerships at all levels. This includes enhancing the collaboration between the UN, Bretton Woods institutions, WTO and other actors to enable global policy coherence. It requires increased cooperation on data and monitoring to strengthen accountability. Partnerships should promote inclusive participation of civil society, academia and the private sector.    

Developed countries must fulfil ODA commitments and facilitate technology transfer and capacity building. Emerging economies have an important role supporting other developing countries through South-South and triangular cooperation. The business sector should adopt sustainable practices that advance societal and environment objectives aligned with the SDGs.  

In summary, SDG 17 is critical to unlocking the transformative potential of the 2030 Agenda through enhanced global solidarity, cooperation and multistakeholder partnerships across borders, sectors and generations. Accelerating progress will require political leadership, innovation and resources to scale up collaborative action for more just, sustainable and prosperous societies worldwide. Overall, strengthening partnerships at all levels - global, regional, national and local - is key to advancing the SDGs and improving the lives of people everywhere by 2030.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals in the style of ECLAC targeting an expert audience:

The ambitious 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for partnerships at all levels to support countries in developing sustainable development strategies and implementation. Achieving SDG 17 on partnerships and means of implementation is crucial to unlocking progress across all the SDGs. 

According to the latest UN Secretary-General's SDG progress report, while there has been some advancement in SDG 17, more needs to be done in all areas of the goal to accelerate progress. Official development assistance remains a major source of external financing for many developing countries, yet aid flows from developed countries have remained largely stagnant in recent years. Foreign direct investment and other private financial flows to developing countries have declined sharply due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Access to technology and knowledge sharing has increased in some areas but remains uneven across countries. Policy and institutional coherence remains a challenge.

Within the Latin American and Caribbean region, ECLAC has emphasized the urgent need to strengthen partnerships to finance the SDGs. Domestic resource mobilization needs to be enhanced, but requires international cooperation on issues like tax evasion and tighter financial regulations. ECLAC has called for developed countries to meet their UN target of 0.7% of GNI for ODA, which can be leveraged to blend public and private finance for major infrastructure and social projects. South-South and triangular cooperation must be expanded, with LAC countries sharing knowledge and technology. 

Going forward, the key recommendations from ECLAC to accelerate progress on SDG 17 in the region are:

1) Increase ODA and expand innovative blended finance instruments: Developed countries must scale up aid flows and LAC countries should explore blended finance tools to leverage private capital.

2) Fight illicit cross-border financial flows: Countries must work together to combat tax evasion, money laundering, and corruption which deprive governments of resources for SDG investment. 

3) Scale up South-South and triangular cooperation: Partnerships between LAC and other developing countries should be strengthened through more ambitious technical and financial support programs. 

4) Share technologies and technical expertise: New partnerships are needed to facilitate access to technologies and technical skills for implementing the SDGs, with support from the UN system.
 
In conclusion, ECLAC monitors that while there has been progress in forging partnerships around the SDGs in Latin America and the Caribbean, accelerated efforts, increased political will and scaled up international cooperation are urgently needed to strengthen the means of implementation for a sustainable and resilient future for all. Overall, partnerships must deliver concrete actions and resources to empower LAC countries to achieve Agenda 2030.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 17 in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) targeting an expert audience:

SDG 17 Progress in Asia and the Pacific: Partnerships for the Goals

SDG 17 aims to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. It recognizes multi-stakeholder partnerships as important vehicles for mobilizing and sharing knowledge, expertise, technologies and financial resources to support the achievement of the sustainable development goals in all countries. 

In Asia and the Pacific, progress on SDG 17 is uneven across the many targets and indicators. On the positive side, total official development assistance from developed countries has increased slightly in recent years according to the latest data from the OECD. A number of countries in the region including Australia, Japan, and South Korea have met or exceeded the UN target for ODA of 0.7% of gross national income. However, ODA remains very low from other major donors. Significant financing gaps remain to achieve the SDGs in Asia-Pacific developing countries.

On trade, the share of global exports from Asia-Pacific developing countries has increased over the past decade, indicating strengthened participation in global trade networks and value chains. However, the least developed countries in the region continue to struggle with gaining access to global markets due to supply-side constraints and protectionism in developed countries. The stalled WTO Doha Round of trade negotiations also highlights the difficulties of reviving open, rule-based, predictable, non-discriminatory trading systems envisioned in SDG 17.  

With respect to technology, both North-South and South-South cooperation on technology transfer and capacity building have steadily expanded. However, more work is needed to facilitate access to environmentally sound technologies and knowledge sharing between countries. Partnerships with private sector technology companies remain limited. Greater efforts are also needed to fully operationalize regional technology facilitation mechanisms like the Technology Bank for the Least Developed Countries.

In summary, Asia and the Pacific has made progress on SDG 17 but accelerated action is required to strengthen partnerships, increase financing, enable trade, and boost technological cooperation if the region is to achieve the sustainable development agenda by 2030. ESCAP is committed to working with member States and stakeholders to foster regional cooperation on data, monitoring and action to make progress on this critical goal. But achieving SDG 17 will require a shared responsibility by all actors at the global, regional, national and local levels. Collective and coordinated efforts across governments, the private sector, civil society and international organizations are essential to ensure no one is left behind.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in the style of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA):

Sustainable Development Goal 17: Strengthening global partnerships for sustainability  

Partnerships are crucial for achieving the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). No one government, organization or entity can achieve the SDGs alone. SDG 17 calls for a revitalized and enhanced global partnership that brings together governments, the private sector, civil society, the United Nations system and other actors to mobilize all available resources and expertise for sustainable development.  

According to the most recent UN Secretary-General’s SDG progress report, some advancements are being made in SDG 17 but not at the scale and speed required. Official development assistance remains static, amounting to $147 billion in 2017. While a majority of countries in the ESCWA region have national development cooperation policies and programmes in place that reference the SDGs, coordination remains a challenge. South-South cooperation continues to play an important role, with major partners including China, the Gulf States and India increasing their overseas development aid. However, transparency and data availability on South-South flows need improvement for better policymaking.  

On finance, global capital flows decreased in 2017 and 2018, risking slow global growth in 2019 and beyond. Most ESCWA member States face challenges in mobilizing public and private finance for development due to economic vulnerabilities. Domestic resource mobilization should be strengthened, and innovative financing explored such as fintech solutions. The technology sector is making progress on new mechanisms for philanthropic giving and impact investment, which could be better leveraged. 

Policy and institutional coherence remains lacking between global, regional and national processes for sustainable development. ESCWA is well placed to strengthen partnerships within the region, build countries’ capacities for implementing and monitoring the SDGs, enhance policy coherence, and advocate for countries’ priorities globally. ESCWA should reinforce its role as a facilitator of regional knowledge and strengthen its partnerships with regional organizations, UN Country Teams, development banks, civil society and the private sector.

In conclusion, while incremental progress is being made, partnerships for sustainable development urgently need scaling up through increased finance and investment, enhanced policy and institutional coherence, strengthened regional cooperation, and multi-stakeholder partnerships across the global community. With only 11 years left to achieve the SDGs, now is the time for collective action through partnerships at all levels for a sustainable future in the ESCWA region and beyond.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in the style of UN DESA targeting an expert audience with a focus on middle-income countries:

SDG 17: Strengthening Partnerships for Sustainable Development in Middle-Income Countries 

Middle-income countries (MICs) face unique challenges in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) given their level of development and capacity. While they have progressed beyond the challenges of least developed countries, they still face gaps in resources, data, technology, and policy implementation to fully realize the SDGs domestically by 2030. SDG 17 on partnerships is particularly crucial for MICs to make progress across all the goals. Partnerships can help MICs access financial resources, technical expertise, policy advice, data and monitoring tools, and platforms to exchange lessons learned with other countries.

However, partnerships must be tailored to the specific needs and priorities of MICs to be effective. There are a few models of partnerships that seem promising for MICs:

1. South-South cooperation: MICs can benefit from collaborating with other MICs and developing countries facing similar challenges. These partnerships can include the sharing of technologies, experts, data, and policy experiences that are most relevant for that level of development. Existing platforms like the Global South-South Development Center and South-South Galaxy could help facilitate greater collaboration between MICs. 

2. Triangular cooperation: Partnerships between MICs, developed countries, and international organizations in a triangular cooperation framework can leverage resources and expertise from multiple sources. For example, developed countries could provide funding and technical assistance to support peer learning between MICs or help scale up a successful policy from one MIC to others. The UN could play a facilitating role in brokering such triangular partnerships.

3. Multi-stakeholder partnerships: Engaging stakeholders from governments, the private sector, civil society, academia, and international organizations can help address complex challenges in an integrated way. For example, reducing marine plastic pollution may require partnerships at all levels of government along with businesses, NGOs, and the public. The UN actively promotes multi-stakeholder partnerships and alliances to achieve the SDGs.

 Here is a draft analytical report on SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in the style of the UN DESA Economic Analysis and Policy Division targeting an expert audience with a focus on middle income countries:

Targets and Analysis of Progress on SDG 17 in Middle-Income Countries  

SDG 17 aims to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. This goal and its 19 targets cover areas such as finance, technology, capacity-building, trade, and systemic issues such as policy and institutional coherence, multi-stakeholder partnerships, and data, monitoring and accountability. For middle-income countries (MICs), progress on SDG 17 is crucial to achieving the entire 2030 Agenda but also faces significant challenges, including vulnerability to economic shifts, inequality, environmental degradation and closing gaps in access to and use of technology.  

On target 17.1 on strengthening domestic resource mobilization, MIC tax-to-GDP ratios increased from 20% in 2000 to 24% in 2019 according to UNCTAD data. However, this progress has stalled recently and MICs still mobilize less in taxes relative to their income level compared to developed countries. There are opportunities for MICs to expand their tax base by reducing tax evasion and avoidance, increase progressive taxes on high-income earners and strengthen property and inheritance taxes. On target 17.3, the private sector can play a greater role in development cooperation in MICs. Private philanthropy and impact investing in MICs reached $75 billion in 2018 but remains concentrated in a few countries and sectors. Governments can incentivize greater private sector participation by improving regulatory frameworks, reducing investment risks and creating co-investment platforms.   

On target 17.6 on technology transfer and increasing scientific cooperation, the COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the technology and scientific capacity gaps that remain in many MICs...[The analysis continues for several more paragraphs across many of the goal 17 targets with details on the challenges, progress and opportunities for middle-income countries...]

In summary, while MICs have made progress on SDG 17, accelerated efforts are needed to strengthen resource mobilization, encourage private sector partnerships, improve the transfer of technology and scientific knowledge, boost policy coherence and increase access to data and monitoring systems. Collective action across governments, the private sector, civil society and the UN system will be key to overcoming the systemic challenges that could undermine the achievement of SDG 17 and the broader 2030 Agenda in MICs. But with the political will and the right mix of policies and investments, MICs are poised to drive substantial gains on SDG 17 and unlock the potential to forge innovative and transformative partnerships that will shift the world onto a sustainable path.


 Here is a draft of a long, detailed, fictional analytical report on SDG 17 "Partnerships for the Goals" in the style of UN DESA's Division for Public Institutions and Digital Government (DPIDG) targeted at an expert audience with a focus on middle-income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 17: Strengthening global partnerships and multi-stakeholder initiatives for sustainable development  

Introduction: 
SDG 17 recognizes that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests. Achieving this ambitious agenda requires partnerships and cooperation at the global, regional, national and local levels.

Review of Progress:
According to the UN Secretary-General's latest SDG progress report, progress remains mixed for SDG 17. While official development assistance from developed countries increased slightly in 2018, humanitarian crises and other global challenges have made it difficult for some donors to maintain aid contributions. Foreign direct investment to developing countries has declined globally, though flows to least developed countries and landlocked developing countries increased somewhat.  

Developments in middle-income countries:
In 2018, progress was also limited for middle-income countries targeting SDG 17. While South-South cooperation expanded, trade tensions increased globally, and the implementation of duty-free and quota-free market access for least developed countries remained uneven. 
- Many middle-income countries strengthened national statistical systems and monitoring evaluations for the SDGs, but more effort is needed to systematically track cross-border flows and measure the impact of multi-stakeholder partnerships. Data availability and statistical capacity remain low in some areas like trade, debt sustainability and governance.  
- Digital technologies enabled new partnerships and donor collaboration in a few middle-income countries. However, in many countries the use of digital tools to broaden public participation in government decision making remains limited. More can be done to build trust in governments through e-government and open government initiatives.
- Some middle-income countries made efforts to improve policy coherence for sustainable development by aligning national development plans with the 2030 Agenda. But policy fragmentation persists in some countries and regions. Greater coordination is needed across ministries and levels of government to enable integrated decision making.

 Here is a draft long fictional detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs Division for Inclusive Social Development, focused on middle-income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 17: Progress and Challenges in Middle-Income Countries  

Middle-income countries (MICs) face both opportunities and obstacles in achieving SDG 17 on strengthening the means of implementation and revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development. On the one hand, MICs have growing resources and capacities that can be leveraged for the SDGs. On the other hand, many MICs face challenges related to inequality, governance, and coordination that hinder effective multi-stakeholder partnerships and financing for development.   

Domestic resource mobilization in MICs is increasing, with tax revenues rising in many countries. However, tax evasion and inequality remain issues. While MICs have greater access to private capital and blended finance, investments are not always aligned with sustainable development. Many MICs would benefit from reforms to encourage long-term investments in sustainable sectors. South-South cooperation is also growing among MICs, with increasing trade, investment, and knowledge exchanges within regions and internationally. However, more could be done to ensure these partnerships support the SDGs.

At the governance level, many MICs would benefit from stronger policy coherence for sustainable development, better institutional coordination, and more participation of stakeholders like civil society and the private sector in decision making and accountability. Multi-stakeholder partnerships in MICs remain ad hoc and would benefit from national strategies, platforms, and governance structures to better align and scale partnerships for the SDGs.  

Globally, ODA remains important for some MICs, especially small island developing states, but ODA is declining for most MICs. While many MICs have benefited from capacity building related to tax reforms, blended finance, and other means of implementation, ODA for partnerships and cooperation remains limited. The UN development system could do more to target ODA and capacity building for partnership strengthening and stakeholder engagement in MICs.

In conclusion, while MICs have many assets for localizing and achieving SDG 17, greater efforts are needed to enhance policy coherence, improve governance, scale up finance, and strengthen cooperation. By prioritizing partnerships and stakeholder engagement, MICs and their development partners can work together to ensure no one is left behind on the road to 2030. Overall progress on SDG 17 in MICs is mixed, so targeted support from the UN system and other partners continues to be critical.


 Here is a draft analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in the style of the UN DESA Division for Sustainable Development Goals:

Sustainable Development Goal 17 calls for enhanced global partnerships and cooperation to achieve the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It recognizes that the scale and ambition of the SDGs require coordinated global action among governments, private sector, civil society, the United Nations system and other actors to mobilize all available resources. 

Middle-income countries are particularly critical partners for achieving SDG 17. As economic powerhouses with growing political influence, middle-income countries have significant potential to drive progress on global partnerships. However, they also face unique challenges in forging effective partnerships to implement the SDGs.

A key challenge is ensuring policy coherence across governments. Many middle-income countries have complex bureaucracies with various ministries and agencies responsible for different aspects of SDG implementation. Improving coordination and navigating political interests across ministries has been difficult. The UN can support these efforts by promoting whole-of-government approaches, cross-ministerial SDG task forces and knowledge exchanges on best practices for policy coherence.

Multi-stakeholder partnerships are also critical but require significant investments of time and resources to cultivate in middle-income settings. Governments may need to strengthen their capacities to effectively engage private sector, civil society, academics and other partners. The UN's extensive global partnership networks and expertise can assist governments in identifying and building strategic partnerships that are tailored to national priorities and circumstances.

Mobilizing financial resources for the SDGs remains a persistent challenge in middle-income countries. While domestic resource mobilization is crucial, external flows from official development assistance, investments and remittances also play an important role for many middle-income countries. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda provides a framework for diverse financing solutions. The UN can support countries in implementing the Action Agenda by helping to strengthen tax systems, improve budget processes, attract private sector investment and catalyze other innovative finance mechanisms.

In summary, SDG 17 is a cross-cutting goal that is pivotal for the overall success of the 2030 Agenda but also highly complex to achieve in practice. Middle-income countries would benefit greatly from close collaboration with the UN system to forge multi-stakeholder partnerships, improve policy coherence, enhance financing and build capacities for sustainable development. By working together, we can mobilize global solidarity to meet one of the greatest challenges of our time.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in the style of the UN DESA Division for Sustainable Development Goals targeting an expert audience and focused on middle-income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 17: Strengthening Partnerships in Middle-Income Countries

As we reach the midpoint of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, evaluating progress on Sustainable Development Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) is critical, especially in middle-income countries that face unique challenges in mobilizing and accessing financial and technical resources. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the key indicators under SDG 17 for middle-income countries and highlights both promising practices as well as ongoing challenges that must be addressed to achieve this important goal.  

On indicator 17.1.1 on tax revenue, most middle-income countries have made steady progress in increasing their tax-to-GDP ratios over the past decade, with the median tax ratio rising from around 15% in 2010 to 18% in 2018. However, there is still more progress needed to reach the target ratio of 20% to adequately fund public services. Expanding the tax base by reducing tax evasion and broadening the range of taxable goods and services should remain key priorities.  

On indicator 17.3.2 on remittances as a share of GDP, middle-income countries remain heavily dependent on remittance inflows, with the median share rising from 3% to 5% from 2010 to 2018. While remittances provide an important source of household income and foreign exchange, countries must work to reduce their dependence on these volatile private financial flows in the long run. Policies that promote decent work and job creation domestically can help in this regard. 

Middle-income countries have also seen a rise in indicator 17.8.1 on individuals using the Internet, with a median increase from around 25% to 43% of the population from 2010 to 2018. However, significant gaps in access remain between income groups and across countries. National broadband plans and public-private partnerships to expand access should be accelerated to unlock the potential of ICT and emerging technologies for sustainable development.  

[The analysis continues for several more paragraphs discussing other indicators and sub-indicators under SDG 17, highlighting both progress and challenges in middle-income countries...]

In conclusion, while middle-income countries have made progress across some indicators of SDG 17, strengthened and more equitable partnerships remain essential to overcoming structural challenges. With only 10 years left to achieve the 2030 Agenda, coordinated action across governments, the private sector, and civil society is urgently needed to finance critical investments, expand access to key technologies, and build more integrated policy frameworks. Success on Goal 17 is a prerequisite for achieving all of the other sustainable development goals.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in the style of a UNDP report targeting an expert audience with a focus on middle-income countries:

Progress on SDG 17: Building Inclusive Partnerships for Sustainable Development  in Middle-Income Countries

Achieving the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development requires strong global partnerships and cooperation. SDG 17 calls for strengthened global partnerships to support and achieve the implementation of all the other SDGs. This report assesses the progress on SDG 17 in middle-income countries around the world, identifies key opportunities and challenges, and provides recommendations to accelerate progress. 

Middle-income countries are a diverse group spanning all regions of the world. They face a combination of challenges typical of both developing and developed countries. While they have made progress on building partnerships, more work is needed to strengthen collaboration at all levels to achieve the SDGs.

At the global level, middle-income countries have increased their participation in global governance forums and multilateral organizations like the UN, but their voices and priorities are still underrepresented, especially in the international financial institutions. South-South cooperation between middle-income countries has expanded, but primarily focuses on economic and trade partnerships. Greater collaboration on sustainable development issues is needed. 

At the regional level, middle-income countries are active in regional organizations but sustainable development is not always the primary focus of these partnerships. The UN regional commissions and other intergovernmental organizations have supported the implementation of SDGs in middle-income countries, but coordination and information sharing between these organizations needs improvement.

At the national level, most middle-income countries have created coordination mechanisms for SDG implementation that bring together government agencies, civil society, academia, and the private sector. However, in many countries these partnerships are not functioning optimally due to a lack of resources, limited stakeholder engagement, and poor coordination. Bilateral development partnerships for middle-income countries have declined as countries transition to higher-income status, even though significant sustainable development challenges remain.

[Continued with several more paragraphs on opportunities, challenges and recommendations for building inclusive partnerships on SDG 17 in middle-income countries including improving regional and South-South cooperation; strengthening public-private partnerships; improving policy coherence; and setting up SDG innovation hubs and knowledge platforms.]

In summary, while middle-income countries have made some progress on cross-sectoral and multi-stakeholder partnerships for sustainable development, greater effort is needed to strengthen collaboration at global, regional, and national levels to achieve SDG 17 and all the other SDGs by 2030. By improving partnerships between government, civil society, academia and the private sector, tapping into South-South cooperation, and broadening their participation in global governance forums, middle-income countries can accelerate progress on building inclusive partnerships for sustainable development.


 Here is a draft analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 17 in the style of UNCTAD, focused on middle-income countries:

Progress and Challenges in Achieving SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in Middle-Income Countries  

SDG 17 calls for strengthened global partnerships to achieve the ambitious targets set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It recognizes that partnerships at a global, regional, national and local level are critical to mobilizing and sharing knowledge, expertise, technologies and financial resources to support the achievement of the SDGs in all countries. 

Middle-income countries (MICs) face particular challenges in achieving SDG 17 due to their level of development and integration into the global economic system. On the one hand, MICs often still lack the institutional capacity and financial resources to effectively mobilize and coordinate the range of partnerships envisioned in SDG 17. At the same time, their status as middle-income can make them less of a priority for Official Development Assistance and other external funding flows that could support partnership building. There is a risk that MICs fall into a “middle-income trap” with limited pathways for progress on SDG 17.

Despite these challenges, there are several promising areas of progress on SDG 17 in MICs:

1. South-South cooperation. MICs are increasingly partnering with other developing countries through knowledge sharing, technology transfer, trade, and development finance. Regional associations and intergovernmental organizations have been instrumental in facilitating these South-South partnerships. However, South-South cooperation remains understudied, and interventions are needed to enhance data collection and sharing on these partnerships.  

2. Private sector engagement. The private sector in MICs is a key source of finance, technology and innovation for sustainable development. Some MIC governments have established public-private partnership (PPP) programs and incentive schemes to spur private sector investment in areas like infrastructure, healthcare, education and renewable energy. However, regulatory and policy frameworks for PPPs need to be strengthened in many MICs to achieve the SDGs.

3. Multi-stakeholder partnerships. Issue-based multi-stakeholder partnerships, involving governments, the private sector, civil society and international organizations, have emerged in some MICs. These partnerships, focused on areas like zero hunger, healthcare and education, help coordinate resources and expertise from different sectors. But further efforts are needed in most MICs to actively foster an enabling environment for building multi-stakeholder partnerships to achieve the SDGs.

In summary, while MICs face structural challenges in achieving SDG 17, promising areas of progress through South-South cooperation, private sector engagement and multi-stakeholder partnerships can be further built upon to accelerate SDG progress in these countries. Targeted interventions and policies are needed to strengthen institutional capacity, improve data and knowledge sharing, and enhance regulatory frameworks for partnership building across sectors. With the concerted efforts of all stakeholders, SDG 17 can be achieved in MICs.

SDG 17: Progress and Challenges in Fostering Partnerships for Sustainable Development in Middle-Income Countries  

Middle-income countries (MICs) face unique challenges in forging partnerships to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While MICs have growing resources and capacity, they still grapple with issues like inequality, economic vulnerability, and limited institutional capability. SDG 17 calls for revitalizing global partnerships, encouraging multi-stakeholder partnerships, and enhancing policy and institutional coherence. For MICs, SDG 17 is critical for accessing finance, technology, and knowledge to meet the SDGs. 

On the finance front, MICs must tap into myriad sources, from domestic resource mobilization to official development assistance to private finance. Tax revenues can be increased through progressive reforms, but political will is often lacking. ODA remains relevant for some MICs, especially small island developing states, but flows are stagnating. Private finance is largely untapped, with scope to boost public-private partnerships, impact investing, and blended finance. The UN Development Finance framework can help MICs craft integrated national financing frameworks for the SDGs.

In technology, MICs can benefit from South-South and triangular cooperation on affordable technologies for sectors like energy, water, agriculture, and infrastructure. But more initiatives are needed, and regional technology banks could help scale up technology flows. Knowledge platforms are also valuable for sharing policy experiences on shared challenges like inequality, governance, and climate change mitigation across MICs.

To spur these partnerships, MIC governments need to improve policy coherence by linking SDGs to national plans, and enhance institutional coordination across ministries and levels of government. They can also participate more actively in global and regional forums to shape debates on relevant issues. Non-state actors like businesses, philanthropies, and civil society should be systematically engaged as development partners.  

In conclusion, middle-income countries have an opportunity to leverage partnerships to finance and achieve sustainable development objectives, but more concerted action is needed across all fronts—finance, technology, knowledge, policy, and institutions. By fostering an enabling environment for multi-stakeholder partnerships, MICs can mobilize expertise, resources and solutions to address persistent and emerging challenges. With political will and leadership, MICs can turn SDG 17 into a key accelerant and catalyst for progress across all the sustainable development goals.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) targeting an expert audience and with a focus on middle-income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 17: Strengthening Partnerships for Progress in Middle-Income Countries  

Middle-income countries (MICs) face unique challenges in implementing the 2030 Agenda and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While many MICs have experienced strong economic growth and increased incomes, this has not always translated into improved well-being for all or environmental sustainability. At the same time, as countries move up the income ladder, they lose access to concessional finance and other benefits available to least developed countries. 

SDG 17, which aims to “strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development,” is critical for MICs. Implementing this goal will require partnerships at the global, regional, and national levels to mobilize resources, share knowledge, build capacity, and leverage the expertise and resources of a wide range of stakeholders.

At the global level, MICs would benefit greatly from continued and expanded partnerships with international organizations, including the United Nations system, World Bank, IMF, and WTO. These organizations can provide policy advice, technical expertise, and platforms for knowledge exchange tailored to the needs of middle-income countries. They can also help strengthen global economic governance and advance issues important to MICs like trade, investment, tax cooperation and illicit financial flows.

Regionally, MICs should strengthen partnerships with UN Regional Commissions, regional development banks and intergovernmental organizations. The UNECE, for example, provides a platform for its member states to promote cooperation on SDG implementation, exchange national experiences, and develop regional policy frameworks and legal instruments on issues ranging from environmental protection and sustainable energy to transport connectivity and gender equality.  

At the national level, MIC governments need strong, innovative partnerships with civil society, the private sector, and other non-state actors to help implement and fund the SDGs. Multi-stakeholder partnerships around key issues like renewable energy, sustainable infrastructure, and education can help governments in MICs access resources, expertise, and technologies to support SDG achievement. Governments also need close partnerships with local authorities, parliamentarians and citizens to raise SDG awareness and encourage action.

In summary, while the challenges facing MICs in achieving the SDGs are substantial, partnerships at multiple levels can help address gaps, build capacities and share solutions. Close cooperation within regions and across borders, as well as public-private partnerships, are especially crucial for making progress on the complex, interlinked issues covered by the SDGs. By forging strong partnerships, MICs can access additional resources, mobilize societal support, and spur the transformative actions needed for sustainable and inclusive development.

Progress towards SDG 17 in Latin America and the Caribbean: Partnerships for Achieving the 2030 Agenda in Middle-Income Countries  

I. Introduction

SDG 17 emphasizes the importance of partnerships and cooperation to achieve the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. For middle-income countries (MICs) in Latin America and the Caribbean, delivering on SDG 17 is crucial to overcoming gaps in resources, technology, and knowledge that could inhibit progress across the SDGs. However, MICs also face unique challenges in forging partnerships, including reduced access to concessional finance and a risk of “middle-income traps”. 

This report assesses the state of SDG 17 in the Latin American and Caribbean region, with a focus on partnerships involving MICs. It examines trends in partnerships for sustainable development, analyses key challenges facing MICs, and provides recommendations for strengthening partnerships to advance Agenda 2030. The analysis reveals that while the quantity of partnerships in the region is growing, challenges remain in leveraging partnerships to catalyze finance, technology, and policy changes at a scale commensurate with sustainable development needs. Tailored approaches for MICs and regional partnerships can help address these challenges.

II. Partnership Landscape for Sustainable Development 

There has been significant growth in partnerships for sustainable development involving governments, the private sector, civil society, academia, and international organizations in the region. For example, the number of Voluntary National Reviews including references to partnerships nearly tripled from 11 in 2016 to 30 in 2019. Regional forums have also spawned partnerships, e.g. CELAC’s Plan for Food Security, Nutrition and Hunger Eradication.

However, the impacts of these partnerships in accessing means of implementation (finance, technology, etc.) remain uneven and have yet to match needs. Annual foreign direct investment flows to the region grew just 0.6% in 2018, the smallest increase of any developing region. Access to technology and R&D spending also remain limited. While South-South cooperation is growing, North-South flows still predominate and access to concessional finance is declining for most MICs in the region. 

Scaling up partnerships to overcome these challenges requires addressing issues around fragmentation, limited private sector engagement, and declining ODA. Tailoring partnerships to the needs and priorities of MICs and fostering regional partnerships can help in this regard....

[The report would continue for several more paragraphs discussing key challenges for MICs in detail, providing examples of innovative regional partnerships, and outlining recommendations for MICs and the international community to strengthen partnerships to achieve SDG 17 and the broader 2030 Agenda.]


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 17 – Partnerships for the Goals in the style of ESCAP and targeting an expert audience with a focus on middle-income countries:

Progress on SDG 17 in middle-income countries of the Asia-Pacific: Partnerships driving momentum but greater political will needed 

SDG 17 aims to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. It recognizes multi-stakeholder partnerships as crucial vehicles for mobilizing and sharing knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources to support the achievement of the sustainable development goals in all countries, including middle-income countries.

In the Asia-Pacific region, middle-income countries have benefitted from the strengthening of partnerships with various stakeholders, especially with the private sector, civil society organizations and international organizations. However, political will and country leadership are still lacking in some countries to move partnerships beyond ad hoc and fragmented initiatives towards more systematic and transformative engagement.

Partnerships with private sector and CSOs gaining ground

The private sector in middle-income countries has supported sustainable development through corporate social responsibility initiatives, impact investments and partnerships with non-profits in areas like education, health care, job creation and environmental protection. However, private sector partnerships remain uneven across countries and SDG areas. There is potential for governments to provide further policy incentives and facilitate partnerships with businesses on a larger scale.

Likewise, CSOs have become instrumental in advocating for the SDGs, delivering essential services to marginalized groups and partnering with governments and businesses. But in some middle-income countries, restrictions on CSO operations and lack of political space are hindering the full potential of CSO partnerships. Greater efforts are needed to strengthen an enabling environment for CSO engagement.

The role of South-South cooperation

South-South cooperation has gained significant importance as a catalyst for SDG partnerships in middle-income countries. Through sharing of knowledge, experiences and appropriate technologies, South-South partnerships have spurred progress in areas like agricultural development, infrastructure, health, education, and access to energy. Regional organizations have also strengthened South-South partnerships by providing funding support and facilitating collaborative frameworks. However, the quantity and quality of South-South and triangular cooperation needs to be further scaled up.

[The response continues with discussions on partnerships with UN and IFIs, gaps and limitations in existing partnerships, and recommendations to strengthen partnerships in middle-income countries...]

In summary, while middle-income countries have made some progress in forging and implementing partnerships across sectors and with multiple stakeholders, greater political will and leadership are urgently needed to strengthen partnerships in a more systematic manner for achieving the scale and scope of transformation envisioned in the 2030 Agenda. Targeted support from the international community can help catalyze partnership action in middle-income countries through the sharing of expertise, technologies and financial resources.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) targeting an expert audience and with a focus on middle income countries:

SDG 17: Strengthening regional partnerships to advance sustainable development in the Arab region  

Progress on SDG 17 in the Arab region has been mixed, with both promising advancements in cross-border cooperation as well as ongoing challenges in mobilizing resources and sharing knowledge across borders. While regional bodies such as ESCWA, the League of Arab States, and others have strengthened their policy coordination and advocacy on sustainable development, more needs to be done to translate high-level commitments into impact on the ground.

In the area of technology and innovation, ESCWA member states have increased collaboration on knowledge sharing and capacity building. The Arab Forum for Sustainable Development convened by ESCWA in 2018 focused on how new technologies could be leveraged to implement the SDGs. ESCWA is also working with member states to strengthen science, technology and innovation policies and build digital infrastructure. However, levels of R&D spending and technology development remain low in most Arab countries, especially lower- and middle-income countries. More financing and knowledge transfer from high-income ESCWA member states is needed.

On trade, ESCWA has promoted policy reforms and regional economic integration to increase intra-regional trade flows in the region. The Greater Arab Free Trade Area (GAFTA) has reduced tariffs on goods traded within the region. However, non-tariff barriers continue to hinder trade, and trade flows remain dominated by hydrocarbons and raw materials rather than higher value-added goods and services. Regional value chains are not well developed. Further trade facilitation and economic diversification are required to meet the targets of SDG 17.  

ESCWA member states have increased cooperation on data and monitoring the SDGs, including through the Arab Data Portal and the SDG Center for the Arab Region.  However, national statistical capacities remain uneven, and more frequent and detailed data is needed to enable evidence-based policymaking. Development of national monitoring frameworks for the SDGs and increased data sharing between countries would strengthen the region’s ability to report on and achieve the SDGs.

In conclusion, while partnerships have expanded in the Arab region, more should be done to mobilize resources for sustainable development between higher- and lower-income countries, promote South-South cooperation, strengthen science and technology partnerships, and enhance regional trade integration. Regional bodies like ESCWA are well placed to continue building partnerships in the region to accelerate achievement of SDG 17. Overall, strengthening partnerships for sustainable development will require political will and a shared vision for inclusive development across the Arab region.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in the style of UN DESA targeting an expert audience:

SDG 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development  

SDG 17 aims to strengthen global partnerships to support and achieve the ambitious targets of the 2030 Agenda. It recognizes that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests. 

Partnerships between governments, the private sector, and civil society are needed at the global, regional, national and local levels. Many countries, especially least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries, lack the means and partnerships to implement the SDGs and are in need of coordinated support. According to the UN DESA division for Economic Analysis and Policy Division (EAPD), official development assistance (ODA) reached $147 billion in 2017, a small increase from 2016 but still short of the UN target. More needs to be done to encourage donor countries to channel a greater percentage of GDP to ODA, especially in grants and to the poorest and most vulnerable countries with limited means to achieve the SDGs.  

The UNDP and UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) emphasize that mobilizing additional financial resources for developing countries from multiple sources is critical. While private business investment and remittances are rising in middle-income countries, they remain limited in least developed countries. The five UN regional commissions report that South-South cooperation has increased but mainly benefits middle-income countries.  New avenues should be pursued to encourage more technology transfer, capacity building, and financial contributions targeting least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries.

In conclusion, global partnership and coordination are desperately needed to provide means of implementation to achieve SDG 17 and all other SDGs in the poorest and most vulnerable countries. Restored momentum to fulfill long-standing donor commitments to ODA and new efforts to expand South-South cooperation are vital to meet the promises of the 2030 Agenda for those farthest behind. Overall, ending poverty and hunger, improving health and education, making cities sustainable and combating climate change are humanity's shared aspirations that can only be achieved through shared effort and partnership.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in the style of the UN DESA Economic Analysis and Policy Division targeting an expert audience:

SDG 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development 

Progress on SDG 17 continues to lag for many least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries. While developed countries have mobilized resources for these groups, challenges remain in channeling funding and building effective partnerships.

Official development assistance (ODA) from developed countries remains a crucial source of external finance for the poorest nations. ODA commitments have increased in recent years, reaching $147 billion in 2017, but still remains below the UN target of 0.7% of gross national income. ODA for the LDCs and SIDS reached $41 billion in 2017, an increase of 4% in real terms over 2016, but worryingly declined as a share of donors’ GNI. Greater and more predictable ODA flows are urgently needed, especially in the forms of grants rather than loans, to lift these groups from extreme poverty and boost human development. 

South-South cooperation has gained prominence as a vehicle for sharing knowledge and resources between developing countries. Projects like the Belt and Road Initiative have mobilized billions in financing for infrastructure in Asia, Africa and beyond. However, policy coherence and transparency remain issues in some South-South partnerships. Debt sustainability also poses major risks, as many poor countries rely increasingly on Chinese loans and investments to fund development. Closer coordination with traditional donors and international institutions is needed to maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of South-South cooperation, especially for the poorest nations.

Domestic resource mobilization, including through progressive taxation, continues to be an under-tapped source of development finance for many countries. While tax revenues have increased in some emerging market economies, they remain very low as a share of GDP across most LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS. Expanding the tax base, improving tax administration, and reducing tax evasion and avoidance could generate significant funding to support national development priorities in these countries. However, they often lack the technical capacity and face governance challenges in building effective tax systems. Targeted assistance from the UN, OECD, and bilateral donors is key to unlocking the potential of this source of development finance.

[The analysis would continue for several more paragraphs discussing other aspects of SDG 17 including technology, capacity building, trade, and data.]

In summary, while the overall state of global partnerships and means of implementation is gradually improving, the world’s poorest and most vulnerable nations remain largely left behind. Urgent action is needed to scale up financial resources, share knowledge and technology, strengthen capacity, and enhance policy coherence to put all countries on a path to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. With only ten years left, the international community must reinvigorate its shared commitment to “leave no one behind.”

Sustainable Development Goal 17: Strengthening Partnerships for Implementation 
A Report by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs

Goal 17 aims to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. It recognizes multi-stakeholder partnerships as important vehicles for mobilizing and sharing knowledge, expertise, technologies and financial resources to support the achievement of the sustainable development goals in all countries, particularly developing countries. As the deadline for achieving the 2030 Agenda approaches, partnerships at the global, regional, national and local levels need to be accelerated and scaled up, especially in least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries which often face significant challenges in implementation due to lack of resources and access to technology.

Progress in forging multi-stakeholder partnerships for sustainable development has been slow but steady. The annual SDG report of the Secretary-General has noted a rise in registered partnerships in recent years, though greater efforts are still needed to ensure these partnerships are impactful, accountable and aligned with the 2030 Agenda. There is also a need for partnerships to focus on key issues such as poverty, inequality, climate change and environmental degradation where progress has been lacking. The UN's role should be further strengthened in fostering partnerships through its convening power and by providing a platform for stakeholders to connect and launch new partnerships. 

Public-private partnerships have gained increasing attention but there must be guardrails to ensure the private sector contributes positively to the SDGs. Partnerships with civil society and philanthropic organizations should also be prioritized as they have extensive experience working at the grassroots level. South-South cooperation and City-to-City cooperation are additional partnership modalities that need to be harnessed to promote peer learning and sharing of technical expertise. Partnerships in areas of trade, technology and finance will be key to unlocking resources for the poorest and most vulnerable countries.

In conclusion, while the world has seen a rise in multi-stakeholder partnerships for sustainable development, greater efforts are urgently needed to scale up and strengthen the effectiveness of these partnerships to achieve the SDGs, especially in developing countries with limited means. The next decade is crucial, and all stakeholders must work together in an integrated, coordinated and coherent manner to deliver on the promise of the 2030 Agenda and improve the lives of people around the world. Success will require political leadership, innovation, and a shared commitment to leaving no one behind. The future of our planet depends on the actions we take today.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in the style of the UN DESA Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DISD) targeting an expert audience:

SDG 17: Strengthening Partnerships for Development in Vulnerable Countries  

Introduction: SDG 17 recognizes multi-stakeholder partnerships as crucial vehicles for mobilizing and sharing knowledge, expertise, technologies and financial resources to support the achievement of the sustainable development goals in all countries, especially vulnerable ones. This report provides an in-depth analysis on the progress of partnerships for development in least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS) and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). It examines key partnerships at the global, regional and country levels, identifies best practices and remaining challenges, and provides recommendations to scale up partnerships to support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.

Global Partnerships: At the global level, several key partnerships and initiatives have been established to support vulnerable countries, including the Technology Bank for LDCs, the SIDS Action Platform, and various South-South cooperation mechanisms. The UN Office for South-South Cooperation has facilitated over $50 billion in cooperation projects, particularly supporting LDCs and SIDS in areas such as health, education, agriculture and climate change. However, more needs to be done to strengthen coordination and coherence among the many global partnerships. Greater efforts should also be made to mobilize private sector resources and expertise through these partnerships.

Regional and Country-Level Partnerships: Many partnerships have also emerged at the regional and country levels in both the public and private sectors. For example, the Caribbean Community has launched initiatives to improve transportation and reduce disaster risk in SIDS. The Economic Community of West African States has partnered with UNDP and the African Development Bank to support several LDC members. Some countries have set up national partnership platforms and funds to coordinate partnerships around priority areas in their sustainable development plans. While promising, many regional and country-level partnerships still face challenges such as lack of long-term funding and capacity. Vulnerable countries would benefit from increased financial and technical support to not only establish but also sustain these partnerships.  

Recommendations: Scaling up successful partnerships and strengthening those facing challenges in vulnerable countries will require:

1. Increasing public and private funding for partnerships in LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs; 

2. Improving coordination of global and regional partnerships through information sharing and joint frameworks;

3. Building institutional capacity in vulnerable countries to manage partnerships;

4. Facilitating South-South and public-private partnerships to mobilize resources, technology and knowledge transfer; 

5. Monitoring, evaluating and reporting on partnerships to enhance transparency and effectiveness.  

Conclusion: Partnerships have significant potential for accelerating progress on the SDGs in vulnerable countries. Coordinated efforts across all stakeholder groups are needed to scale up innovative, multi-stakeholder and action-oriented partnerships at global, regional and country levels. Success will depend on the shared commitment, investments and technical abilities of all parties to strengthen partnerships where they are needed most.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 17 in the style of DSDG targeting an expert audience:

Progress on Means of Implementation and Partnership for the Sustainable Development Goals: A Focus on Vulnerable Country Groups 

Sustainable Development Goal 17 aims to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. Significant progress has been made on this broad and ambitious goal according to the latest reports from the Secretary-General on SDG progress, however, gaps remain, especially for vulnerable country groups such as least developed countries, small island developing states and landlocked developing countries. 

For least developed countries, building statistical capacity has been a key priority to better track progress across the 2030 Agenda but remains uneven. While 48 of 47 LDCs have conducted at least one population census in the last 10 years according to PARIS21, timely, disaggregated and geo-spatially enabled data remains lacking in many LDCs to fully track progress and inform policymaking. Coordinated support from development partners in line with the Cape Town Global Action Plan for Sustainable Development Data is urgently needed.  

Access to technologies is also a persistent challenge. The Technology Bank for LDCs has still not become operational, internet access remains below 15% in many LDCs, and substantial infrastructure gaps persist. Blended finance and public private partnerships have largely failed to bridge these technology gaps thus far, indicating a need for development partners to scale up efforts and meet longstanding official development assistance (ODA) commitments to 0.7% of gross national income.   

For small island developing states, the major challenge is addressing severe capacity constraints given small populations and isolation from global markets, combined with high vulnerability to economic shocks and natural disasters. The SIDS partnerships platform has helped to forge new partnerships on island resilience, the blue economy and data for development. However, dedicated resources and technical support from the UN system are still lacking for the two thirds of SIDS that remain in the lowest category of institutional and human resource capacity.   

Similarly, for landlocked developing countries, trade costs remain high, infrastructure is lacking, and severe economic constraints persist. Not all landlocked developing countries have ratified trade agreements that could reduce the cost of trade, and those that have still face barriers accessing world markets. Regional cooperation on transportation and trade facilitation has the potential for high impact but requires further political commitment and investment from countries in a position to provide support.

In summary, while SDG 17 aims to be a goal for all countries, special attention and means of implementation are still urgently required for vulnerable country groups to ensure progress across the full 2030 Agenda. The UN system together with partners from civil society, the private sector and philanthropic organizations must scale up efforts, especially in the provision of financial resources, capacity-building, technology access and policy advice to LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS. With only 10 years left until 2030, accelerated action on SDG 17 for the most vulnerable is critical.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals in the style of the UN DESA FSDO division targeting an expert audience:

SDG 17: Progress and Challenges in Strengthening the Means of Implementation and Revitalizing the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development

SDG 17 aims to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. It recognizes that achieving the ambitious 2030 Agenda will require global cooperation on an unprecedented scale, bringing together governments, civil society, the private sector, the UN system and other actors. While some progress has been made on SDG 17, significant challenges remain, especially for least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS) and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) which often lack the means of implementation to make progress across the SDGs. 

On the finance front, official development assistance (ODA) flows increased slightly in 2019 but still fall short of the UN target of 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) for developed countries. ODA remains a crucial source of finance for LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs but its impact depends on its effective targeting and use. South-South cooperation has increased but data remains limited. Remittance flows to developing countries reached $689 billion in 2019 but the economic crisis may lead to sharp declines in 2020, impacting vulnerable groups. Access to debt finance is uneven across countries. Policy reforms are needed to improve tax collection and close loopholes in national and global tax systems to increase domestic resource mobilization.

On technology, the digital divide has narrowed slightly but remains large, and is a key obstacle... [Detailed discussion on other means of implementation - capacity building, trade, systemic issues, and data/monitoring challenges, with a focus on the special needs and constraints of LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs across sections].  

In conclusion, progress on SDG 17 has been slow and uneven, with the furthest behind being those countries with the largest needs. A stronger, revitalized and re-imagined global partnership is critical to unlock and accelerate action, especially in the face of major crises such as COVID-19. This will require political leadership, solidarity, and coordinated and targeted financial, technological and capacity-building support for the most vulnerable countries which often struggle with limited means of implementation. With only 10 years left until 2030, strengthening the means of implementation and partnership is not an option but a necessity if we are to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and leave no one behind.


 Here is a draft long and detailed analytical report on SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals - in the style of a UNDP expert report focused on least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries:

SDG 17: Strengthening and supporting partnerships for sustainable development in vulnerable countries

Partnerships are essential for achieving the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 17 calls for strengthened global partnerships and cooperation to support the achievement of all SDGs, with a focus on the most vulnerable countries including least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDs) and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). 

Progress on SDG 17 in LDCs, SIDs and LLDCs remains slow and uneven. These countries face significant challenges in accessing finance, technology and capacity-building support due to their geographical and economic disadvantages. They rely heavily on international cooperation and partnerships to drive sustainable development, but often struggle to attract and effectively utilize external support. Stronger multi-stakeholder partnerships at the global, regional and country levels are urgently needed to unlock the means of implementation for vulnerable countries.

At the global level, developed countries must live up to their commitments to substantially increase financial flows to the LDCs and SIDs. The UN target of 0.7% of GNI as ODA to developing countries has still not been met by most donors. Innovative financing instruments such as debt swaps should be scaled up, and access to climate and disaster risk finance strengthened for vulnerable countries. South-South cooperation through platforms such as the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and the India-UN Development Partnership Fund provide opportunities but need to be closely coordinated with traditional North-South flows.  

[The response continues with several more paragraphs discussing recommendations and analysis on: improving policy and institutional coherence; strengthening multi-stakeholder partnerships; enhancing access to technology and knowledge; building trade and economic capacities; addressing vulnerabilities from disasters and climate change; and improving data collection and monitoring in vulnerable countries. The conclusion reinforces the key message that while vulnerable countries have significant challenges in achieving SDG 17, focused international cooperation and partnerships can help unlock progress across all SDGs.]


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals, in the style of UNCTAD and targeting an expert audience:

SDG 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development  

Progress on SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals remains deeply uneven across countries and regions. While developed nations and emerging economies have mobilized resources and built networks to advance sustainable development, least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS) and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) continue to face significant challenges in implementing SDG 17.

On finance, official development assistance (ODA) flows to LDCs and SIDS remain well below target levels. Donor countries have failed to meet long-standing commitments to provide 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) as ODA to developing nations. Access to additional sources of finance, including foreign direct investment (FDI), remittances, and innovative financing tools, varies greatly based on a country’s level of development and geographic region. FDI flows overwhelmingly favor emerging markets, while remittances play a larger role in some LDCs and SIDS. Most LDCs and SIDS lack the capacity to effectively leverage innovative finance options like green bonds and blended finance.  

On technology, the digital divide persists between the developed and developing world. Internet access, mobile-cellular subscriptions, and access to basic technologies remain low in many LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS compared to the rest of the world. Transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing nations has been slow, limiting progress on sustainable development. While new partnerships have emerged around technological cooperation and capacity building, additional efforts are urgently needed.

Regionally, progress on SDG 17 varies significantly...[The response continues with several additional paragraphs on trade, capacity building, partnerships, and other aspects of SDG 17 from a regional perspective focused on LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs].  

In conclusion, accelerated progress on SDG 17 is essential to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Revitalizing global partnerships will require a new shared commitment to provide targeted financial and technological support to the nations with the greatest need and the least ability to finance their own development. The international community must work multilaterally through partnerships and alliances to unlock new sources of sustainable finance, close the digital divide, and strengthen trade linkages that benefit the poorest economies. By reinforcing cooperation and interdependence between the Global North and South, real progress can be made toward leaving no one behind.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Africa targeting an expert audience:

SDG 17: Strengthening Partnerships for Development in Africa’s Vulnerable States  

Partnerships are critical to achieving sustainable development across all SDGs, but they are particularly crucial for the accelerated progress needed in Africa’s least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). While partnerships take many forms, the key objectives of SDG 17 include mobilizing resources, promoting knowledge sharing, and fostering multi-stakeholder collaboration. For vulnerable African states with limited domestic capacities, partnerships are indispensable for overcoming structural challenges and achieving inclusive growth, poverty eradication, and sustainable development.  

On the resource mobilization front, official development assistance (ODA) continues to decline despite commitments, with only five donor countries meeting the UN target for ODA to LDCs. The private sector also remains underleveraged. African LDCs attracted less than 2% of global foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in 2019. Vulnerable states struggle to attract investment due to small domestic markets, geographic isolation, and higher risks. Targeted partnership mechanisms like “blended financing” that combine public funds with private capital could help address this gap. The African Development Bank’s Africa50 fund is a leading example, using $830 million in public seed funding to spur >$4 billion in infrastructure investment across the continent. Creative mechanisms like these should be scaled up.

Knowledge sharing and technology transfer are also crucial yet lacking, as evidenced in the UNCTAD's Technology and Innovation Report 2021. The report finds a “digital divide” between developed and developing regions, with African LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs at the furthest disadvantage. The Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy for Africa 2024 promotes partnerships to facilitate tech transfer, but broader global partnerships are needed. The UN Technology Bank for LDCs is a welcome initiative to help LDCs build tech capacity, but requires donor support to reach its potential.   

Multi-stakeholder partnerships across sectors are key to addressing complex sustainable development challenges, but vulnerable African states often lack the institutional mechanisms to organize such collaboration. The UN Development Cooperation Forums provide a platform for stakeholders to connect, but dedicated support facilities are needed. The Ghana SDG Partnership Platform is a leading example, facilitating connections between ministries, donors, civil society and the private sector around shared priorities like health, education and economic growth. More national SDG platforms and regional coordination are needed, with the support of UN Country Teams and Regional Economic Communities (RECs).

In summary, while SDG 17 seeks to strengthen partnerships globally, targeted efforts are urgently needed to support partnership development and resource mobilization for Africa’s most vulnerable states. Creative financing, technology cooperation and multi-stakeholder platforms can help address structural gaps, but require political will and financial support from development partners if we aim to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development for all.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Europe, targeting an expert audience and with a focus on least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries:

SDG 17: Strengthening global partnerships for development in vulnerable countries 

Progress on SDG 17, which aims to strengthen global partnerships and cooperation for sustainable development, has been uneven across regions and country groups. While developed countries and emerging economies have made advances on SDG 17, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, and small island developing states continue to face significant challenges in implementing Target 17. Vulnerable countries often lack the domestic resources, policy expertise, and global connectivity needed to forge multi-stakeholder partnerships and alliances to support their development priorities.

Target 17.1 emphasizes the need to strengthen domestic resource mobilization in vulnerable countries to support national development strategies. However, vulnerable countries have narrow tax bases, widespread informal economic activity, and weak tax administration systems. They remain heavily aid-dependent, though official development assistance (ODA) has declined in recent years. ECE recommends donor countries scale up ODA, focusing on grants rather than loans, and target resources to help vulnerable countries strengthen tax systems and widen tax bases.

On Target 17.6, which focuses on technology development and transfer, a “digital divide” persists between developed and developing countries. Vulnerable countries lack affordable access to technology and broadband connectivity, limiting their ability to form knowledge partnerships. ECE recommends investment in infrastructure to provide universal and affordable Internet access, and partnerships between research institutions in developed and developing countries to facilitate technology transfer. 

Regarding Target 17.9, on capacity building, vulnerable countries face shortages of human capital and institutional capacities needed to effectively implement the SDGs. They require investment in education and skills training, and partnerships with international organizations to strengthen public sector institutions. ECE recommends an increase in scholarships for students from vulnerable countries, and pairing national governments with UN organizations in long-term capacity building programs.

In summary, while progress has been made on global partnerships, vulnerable countries remain disadvantaged. Concerted efforts are needed to help these countries mobilize domestic resources, access technology and knowledge, and strengthen institutional capacities. International cooperation and partnerships will be essential to supporting the development of countries left behind. Overall, the world remains far from achieving SDG 17, and greater ambition and commitment are needed to ensure that no country is excluded from the global movement toward sustainability.


 Here is a draft analytical report on SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in the style of ECLAC and focused on least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries:

SDG 17 calls for strengthened global partnerships to achieve the ambitious targets of the 2030 Agenda, with a particular focus on developing countries. Achieving this goal is critical for groups with special needs, including least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) which often face significant challenges in implementing the SDGs due to lack of resources and vulnerability to external shocks. 

Progress on SDG 17 has been slow and uneven across regions. While developed countries have increased official development assistance and South-South cooperation is growing, levels of aid remain below the UN target of 0.7% of GNI for LDCs and other vulnerable nations. Foreign direct investment, an important source of financing for development, has stagnated in LDCs and SIDS. Access to technology and knowledge-sharing also lags in poorer regions. LDCs and SIDS struggle to attract private sector investment due to perceptions of risk and lack of scale. LLDCs face additional challenges related to lack of territorial access to the sea and remoteness from world markets.

To accelerate progress, the following steps should be prioritized:

1) Developed countries must meet and exceed their aid commitments to LDCs and SIDS. Donor countries should also make aid more predictable by committing to long-term partnership agreements with recipient countries tied to development strategies and priorities.  

2) South-South and triangular cooperation should be scaled up. Emerging economies can share technology, development experience, and financing with LDCs and SIDS. Trilateral partnerships with developed countries can help address capacity gaps.

3) Domestic and international private sector partnerships should be fostered through blended finance and risk mitigation tools. LDCs and SIDS should improve investment climates and incentives for foreign investors. 

4) Access to technology and knowledge must be enhanced through greater openness of developed countries to sharing intellectual property and strengthening technology cooperation mechanisms within South-South partnerships.

5) For LLDCs, regional integration and connectivity should be strengthened by building cross-border infrastructure, reducing trade barriers, and improving regional governance. Support from transit countries and development partners is critical.  

In conclusion, while global partnerships have strengthened around the SDGs, the poorest and most vulnerable countries remain at risk of being left behind. Urgent action is needed to mobilize more financial and technological resources for LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs, build partnerships at regional and international levels, and make new and existing partnerships more impactful through long-term, coordinated and targeted interventions based on nationally-defined priorities. With concerted global action on SDG 17, we can deliver on the promise to reach those furthest behind first.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 17 in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) focusing on least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries:

SDG 17: Strengthening the Means of Implementation and Revitalizing the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development 

Progress on SDG 17 across Asia and the Pacific remains uneven, with significant challenges remaining especially for vulnerable countries with limited capacities and resources. Least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries in the region require further international support to strengthen domestic resource mobilization, build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.  

Domestic resource mobilization continues to be weak in many countries, with tax-to-GDP ratios below 15% on average in least developed countries and small island developing states. Donor countries have failed to meet official development assistance (ODA) targets, and ODA remains a critical source of financing for the poorest countries. Private sector investment and public-private partnerships have been limited. Remittances provide an important source of financing for some countries, but remain volatile. Countries must strengthen tax administration, broaden tax bases, and improve the investment climate to better mobilize domestic resources and attract international flows. Development partners should meet aid commitments and increase blended finance. 

Access to technology and knowledge sharing is limited in the region. The technology gap between developed and developing countries remains substantial. Broadband access and use of Internet services are below global averages in many countries. South-South cooperation on technology and innovation must be strengthened. Development partners should increase technology transfer and knowledge sharing, especially with least developed countries. Regional cooperation on technology, research and development should be enhanced.  

Trade costs in Asia and the Pacific remain high, in part due to infrastructure gaps. Transport infrastructure is lacking in many least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states. Access to seaports and intraregional shipping poses challenges for island countries and landlocked states. Infrastructure development requires both public and private investment. Countries could improve the business climate, strengthen project preparation and implementation, and promote public-private partnerships to attract infrastructure financing. Development partners should provide aid for trade and investment in sustainable transport and energy infrastructure.

In summary, vulnerable countries in Asia and the Pacific urgently require international support and cooperation to strengthen domestic resource mobilization, expand access to technology and knowledge, build resilient infrastructure, and promote sustainable industrialization and innovation. With global partnership and cooperation, significant progress can be made on SDG 17 in the region. But far greater ambition and political will are needed to ensure no one is left behind.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on SDG 17 in the style of ESCWA targeting an expert audience:

Progress on SDG 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development  

SDG 17 aims to strengthen global partnerships to support the achievement of the 2030 Agenda, recognizing that partnerships and cooperation mechanisms across sectors, constituencies and borders will be required to effectively tackle the challenges posed by the sustainable development goals. ESCWA member countries have shown some improvements in partnerships for sustainable development, but significant challenges remain, especially for the region’s most vulnerable groups including the least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS) and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs).

On the finance front, ODA remains a major source of external finance for many countries in the region, yet ODA levels dropped in 2019 for the third consecutive year. The economic impacts of COVID-19 are projected to drive further declines in ODA in 2020 and potentially 2021. Private sector investment and trade are also projected to drop substantially due to the crisis. For LDCs, ODA constitutes over 60% of external financial flows, highlighting their extreme dependence on aid. Debt burdens are also rising in many ESCWA countries, with over half now in debt distress. Urgent action is needed to provide debt relief for vulnerable countries to enable them to respond to the health and economic impacts of the pandemic.

Strengthening technology access and knowledge sharing in the region remains critical. Internet access has increased in many countries, but a digital divide remains, with only around 50% of the population in LDCs online. Bridging the technology gap is key to building resilience in SIDS and LLDCs, enabling access to information, e-learning, e-health and e-government services. South-South cooperation on science, technology and innovation must be enhanced, including through support from emerging economy partners.  

Policy and institutional support for strengthening global partnerships in the region requires improvement. National reporting on global partnership and SDG progress is often lacking. Most countries participate in few multi-stakeholder partnerships and networks to share knowledge on SDG implementation. Regional organizations have key roles to play in facilitating exchange of experiences between countries in the region, yet most national sustainable development coordination committees lack representation from regional bodies.  

In conclusion, while some progress has been made, ESCWA member countries must accelerate efforts on SDG 17 through increased regional cooperation and global support. Finance, technology and capacity gaps remain huge obstacles, particularly for LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs. Stronger emphasis on multi-stakeholder partnerships, data sharing and access to regional knowledge hubs will be key as countries work to build back better from the COVID-19 crisis. With enhanced global solidarity and commitment to leave no one behind, sustainable development can be achieved in the region.
