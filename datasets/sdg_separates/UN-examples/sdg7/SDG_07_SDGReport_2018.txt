Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all
Ensuring access to affordable, reliable and modern energy for all has come one step closer due to recent progress in electrification, particularly in LDCs, and improvements in industrial energy efficiency. However, national priorities and policy ambitions still need to be strengthened to put the world on track to meet the energy targets for 2030.
fFrom 2000 to 2016, the proportion of the global population with access to electricity increased from 78 per cent to 87 per cent, with the absolute number of people living without electricity dipping to just below 1 billion.
fIn the least developed countries, the proportion of the people with access to electricity more than doubled between 2000 and 2016.
fIn 2016, 3 billion people (41 per cent of the worldâ€™s population) were still cooking with polluting fuel and stove combinations.
fThe share of renewables in final energy consumption increased modestly, from
17.3 per cent in 2014 to 17.5 per cent in 2015. Yet only 55 per cent of the renewable share was derived from modern forms of renewable energy.
fGlobal energy intensity decreased by 2.8 per cent from 2014 to 2015, double the rate of improvement seen between 1990 and 2010.
