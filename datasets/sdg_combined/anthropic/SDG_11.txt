Making Progress on Sustainable Cities: An Assessment of SDG 11  

By The New York Times

Around the world, more people are living and migrating to cities and urban centers than ever before. According to the United Nations, 55% of the world's population currently resides in cities, and that number is projected to increase to 68% by 2050. This rapid urbanization poses serious challenges to sustainable development. However, with thoughtful investments and policies, cities can become incubators for innovation and prosperity.  

The UN's Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable." According to the UN's latest SDG progress report, while there has been progress on targets like access to public transit and open spaces, other targets like reducing the adverse environmental impact of cities remain far from being achieved. Key priorities going forward include investments in affordable housing, upgrading slum settlements, and disaster risk reduction.

Some of the greatest progress on SDG 11 can be seen in the UN's own backyard, New York City. Under Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York has greatly expanded its affordable housing initiatives, increased access to high-speed internet for low-income groups, and continues to make major investments in public infrastructure and transportation. The city aims to further reduce GHG emissions by transitioning its major buildings to renewable energy and upgrading its aging subway system. However, like other cities, New York continues to struggle with challenges like homelessness, air pollution and waste management.  

Around the world, cities like Seoul, Singapore and Bogota have also made substantial progress on SDG 11 by improving housing, transportation, green spaces and civic participation. Meanwhile, sprawling unplanned cities in the developing world face serious challenges. The UN's SDG progress report finds that overcrowding, lack of green spaces, and substandard housing remain major problems in many cities of sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia. Achieving SDG 11 will require major coordinated investments in urban planning, infrastructure, and governance.

While progress on SDG 11 is uneven, cities around the world are pioneering innovative solutions for sustainable urban living. From new models of affordable housing in Latin America to all-electric public transit in Shenzhen, China, cities are at the forefront of a more sustainable future for our planet. Overall, cities have shown that achieving the vision of SDG 11 is challenging yet within our reach if the political will exists. With forward-thinking policies, investments and partnerships, cities can drive progress on sustainable development for generations to come.

Sustainable Cities: A Global Challenge and Opportunity 

By Your Assistant

Urbanization is one of the 21st century’s most transformative trends. As the world’s population expands to a projected 9.8 billion people by 2050, close to 70% are expected to live in cities and other urban areas. While cities have long been centers of innovation and economic opportunity, rapid urbanization also brings challenges like increased pollution, poverty, inequality, and health issues. 

Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. This is a formidable task that will require cooperation across governments, the private sector, and civil society. Progress is mixed but there are bright spots of success that provide a roadmap for future efforts.

The first key is promoting access to adequate and affordable housing for all. Despite progress, over 1 billion people still live in slums or informal settlements, lacking basic services and insecure tenure. Programmes like slum upgrading, increasing affordable housing units, and secure land tenure rights have shown promise and should be priorities. Infrastructure and transportation systems must also keep pace to support growing populations, reduce pollution and improve quality of life in cities. Innovations in public transit, bike sharing, renewable energy infrastructure and more can enhance sustainability and access for underserved communities.  

Planning and management are crucial for optimizing the growth of cities. When coordinated properly, density can make public services more efficient and affordable. However, without proper planning overcrowding strains resources and worsens inequality. Innovations in data collection and open governance can empower citizens to participate in urban planning and make their voices heard. New technologies like artificial intelligence and virtual/augmented reality also offer opportunities to improve urban planning simulations and stakeholder engagement.

Building Sustainable Cities and Communities for All: Progress and Challenges Ahead  

By Your AI Assistant

In 2015, the United Nations adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. SDG 11 focuses on making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. According to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), over half of the world's population now lives in cities, and that number is projected to rise to nearly 70% by 2050. With rapid urbanization, sustainable development challenges are concentrated in cities.

Progress has been made on some SDG 11 targets, but accelerated action is needed. According to the UN Secretary-General's latest SDG report, the proportion of the global urban population living in slums fell to around 23% in 2020. However, in sub-Saharan Africa, 55% of urban dwellers still live in slums. Many cities have policies to upgrade slums, but implementation is slow. The number of cities with over 100,000 inhabitants adopting and implementing policies and plans towards inclusion, resource efficiency, and resilience to disasters is also growing, but many still lack basic services like sanitation, sustainable mobility systems, and disaster risk reduction planning.  

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of sustainable cities. Densely populated cities have seen rapid spread of the virus, highlighting needs for improved basic services and housing. The crisis has also underscored the importance of green spaces for mental and physical health. At the same time, tighter city budgets may threaten sustainability programs. Partnerships across all sectors can help address these challenges.  

The Road Ahead: Bold steps can help achieve SDG 11. Investing in public spaces, clean transport and smarter infrastructure can make cities greener and safer. Upgrading slums and providing affordable housing promote inclusion. Support for city-level partnerships and data-sharing facilitate sustainable urban policymaking and disaster resilience. Finance for sustainability initiatives in the developing world remains key. Achieving SDG 11 is critical for the future sustainability of our planet. With concerted action by all stakeholders, sustainable cities and communities for all can be within reach.

Cities are Hubs of Innovation But Inequality Persists: Progress on Making Cities Inclusive, Safe, Resilient and Sustainable 

By Your AI Assistant

Cities are centers of culture, commerce, and innovation, but many still struggle with poverty, inequality, and lack of access to basic services. Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. According to the latest UN progress report, some gains have been made but more needs to be done.

More than half the world's population lives in cities, and that number is growing rapidly, especially in developing countries in Africa and Asia. While cities drive economic growth, many still lack access to affordable housing, safe and sustainable transport systems, and other basic infrastructure and services. The UN has set targets under SDG 11 to address inadequate housing, lack of public spaces, and other challenges facing many cities and communities worldwide.

Some of the targets focus on access to safe and affordable housing and upgrading slums. The proportion of urban population living in slums in the developing regions has declined to around 23 percent, but in least developed countries the share is 43 percent. Access to safe and eco-friendly transport is also a priority. Deaths from road traffic injuries have decreased in many regions but air pollution from vehicles remains dangerously high in most cities. 

Public spaces also need improvement. According to the report, open public space per capita has increased in many cities but remains limited in large cities of developing regions. Waste management and access to green spaces are other targets that still require more attention. Progress on building sustainable and resilient infrastructure using eco-friendly materials and energy efficiency technologies has been slow.

Overall, most regions have recorded progress on certain SDG 11 targets, especially on housing, but accelerated efforts are needed on sustainable transport, pollution reduction, inclusive urban planning and disaster risk management. Partnerships between governments, the private sector and civil society are key to improving cities and making them more livable and sustainable, according to the UN Secretary-General. With visionary leadership and investments in green infrastructure, cities can drive sustainable development and be a source of prosperity for generations to come. But more political will is needed to make that vision a reality.

Sustainable Cities: A Global Challenge and Opportunity  

By Your Assistant

Making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable is one of the biggest collective challenges and opportunities of our time. According to the United Nations, 55% of the world's population currently lives in urban areas, a proportion that is expected to increase to 68% by 2050. Cities are the engines of global economic growth, generating over 80% of global GDP. However, rapid urbanization is generating challenges around housing, transportation, energy systems and other infrastructure and services. There is an urgent need to improve planning and management for the wellbeing of all.   

Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. This includes targets around adequate, safe and affordable housing, upgrading slums, providing access to safe and affordable transport systems, reducing environmental impacts, and building inclusive and sustainable urbanization. According to the UN's latest SDG progress report, while some progress has been made, accelerated efforts are urgently needed to achieve SDG 11 by 2030.  

Adequate housing is still a challenge for over 1 billion urban residents living in slums or informal settlements. The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted huge gaps in access to housing, basic services and social protections in many cities. Transportation and mobility are also issues, as many cities face challenges with inadequate public transit, traffic congestion, and lack of safe infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists. Cities consume over two-thirds of the world's energy and account for more than 70% of global CO2 emissions, so improving energy efficiency and shifting to renewable energy are priorities. Waste management, air pollution, lack of green spaces, and insufficient disaster response plans are other issues facing cities.  

Despite these challenges, cities are hubs of innovation and progress. Many cities and local governments have been pioneers in working towards sustainability and the SDGs. Cities that have made progress have benefited from strong, inclusive governance, long-term planning, investment in public services, and community participation. New technologies are helping to build "smarter cities" that leverage tools like AI and big data to improve resource efficiency. The private sector also has an important role to play through sustainable business practices, partnerships, and investment.

Achieving SDG 11 will require coordinated global action to support local communities and city leaders around the world. Political commitment, decentralized governance, knowledge sharing, data-driven decision making and blended financing models that combine public and private sector resources will all be instrumental to turning cities into inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable places for all. With concerted action, cities can lead the world into a sustainable future. But we have no time to lose.

The Future is Urban: Why SDG 11 Matters 

By the Assistant

The future of our planet will be decided in cities. Today, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, and that figure is projected to rise to nearly 70% by mid-century. Cities are the engines of the global economy, generating more than 80% of global GDP. But they also face immense challenges, including poverty, inequality, lack of affordable housing, traffic congestion, and pollution. 

That is why Sustainable Development Goal 11, which aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable," is so crucial. This SDG touches on so many of the issues that will shape our collective future. Achieving it will require cooperation and coordination across governments, the private sector, and civil society in areas ranging from infrastructure and transportation to energy and natural resource management.

Some of the most important targets under SDG 11 include providing access to safe and affordable housing and upgrading slums, improving transport systems and road safety, protecting cultural and natural heritage, reducing the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, and improving urban planning and management.These targets aim to tackle issues that affect the poorest and most vulnerable city residents while making urban areas greener, safer, and more livable for all.

We have already seen progress in some areas, including wider access to public transit systems, increased preservation of historic urban areas, and more mixed-used development with affordable housing. But we still have a long way to go. Traffic congestion, lack of safe pedestrian infrastructure, and urban poverty persist in cities around the world.  ... [Additional details and examples on progress and remaining gaps]

Our cities can and should be Sustainable, inclusive, and livable for all. Achieving SDG 11 will require massive investments in infrastructure and transportation, good urban planning, and political will. But the potential benefits to both current and future generations are huge. Our shared future depends on building cities that are engines of innovation, inclusion, and environmental sustainability. The next decade will be critical, and we all have a role to play as citizens, consumers and community members to advocate for progress on SDG 11. Together, we can shape cities that reflect the best of human achievement. Our future depends on it.


 Here is a draft Op-ed in the style of Paul Krugman on SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities:

The Challenge of Building Inclusive, Safe, Resilient and Sustainable Cities  

 By 2050, close to 70% of the world's population will live in urban areas. Our cities are engines of growth and innovation, but they also concentrate challenges like poverty, inequality, environmental degradation and disasters. Achieving SDG 11 on sustainable cities and communities is critical to overall progress on the 2030 Agenda. 

Building inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable cities requires tackling multidimensional challenges. On inclusion, we must address lack of basic services, infrastructure, housing, and public spaces for many urban residents, especially the poor and marginalized. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated vulnerabilities and inequalities in cities, with the most marginalized groups suffering the most. In many cases, those without access to basic services like water and sanitation have struggled to follow recommended hygiene practices.  

On safety, violence and insecurity pose major threats. Crime and violence cost cities billions each year. Women and girls face additional threats of harassment and sexual violence, limiting their freedom of movement and access to opportunities. Achieving inclusion and safety requires investments in affordable housing, infrastructure, public services, and community engagement, with a focus on those furthest behind.  

On resilience, many cities face environmental and disaster risks like pollution, climate change impacts, earthquakes and flooding. Poorly-planned cities with inadequate infrastructure and services are highly vulnerable, but resilience is within reach if we make the right policy choices and investments now. Ecosystem-based adaptation, resilient infrastructure, emergency response systems and early warning networks can help protect people and assets.   

Finally, sustainability requires transitioning to renewable energy, sustainable transport systems, green spaces, and resource efficiency. Many cities have set ambitious climate targets, but we need faster progress. Reimagining cities as sustainable, low-carbon communities will spur innovation and job creation, with benefits extending well beyond city borders.  

There is no one-size-fits-all solution for the complex challenges facing cities. But inclusive decision-making, integrated planning, and tapping the potential of new technologies can help accelerate progress. Strong political leadership and partnerships across all levels of government and with businesses and civil society are also key. Achieving SDG 11 will require massive investments, but the long-term benefits to citizens and economies are enormous. Our shared future depends on building cities that work for all people and the planet. The time for action is now.

Sustainable Cities: An Urban Challenge that Will Define Our Future 

Our planet is urbanizing at an unprecedented rate. Today, more than half the world's population lives in cities, and that figure is projected to rise to nearly 70% by 2050. This mass migration to cities poses one of the greatest challenges to global sustainable development. If managed well, cities can drive economic growth and prosperity. If mismanaged, they can exacerbate poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation.

Sustainable Development Goal 11 calls on the global community to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable." This is a tall order that will require coordinated action at all levels of government, business, and civil society. But the rewards for success are enormous, as sustainable cities can drive solutions to many of humanity's greatest challenges.

For cities to be sustainable, the first priority must be inclusion. Cities need to provide equal access to resources and opportunities regardless of gender, ethnicity, religion, age, sexual orientation, disability status or other characteristics. Exclusion and segregation within cities exacerbates inequality and undermines social cohesion. Inclusive cities, on the other hand, tap into the energy and creativity of all residents. 

Second, cities must be safe and resilient in the face of natural and man-made disasters. As climate change intensifies, cities face greater risks from events like hurricanes, floods, heat waves and droughts. Emergency preparedness and climate adaptation are critical, as extreme weather events can easily overwhelm basic infrastructure and services. Resilient cities also need to plan for "grey swan" events - low probability, high impact disruptions from sources like cyber-attacks, pandemics or infrastructure failures. 

Finally, sustainable cities require sustainable living standards and consumption patterns. The world's cities consume over two-thirds of the world's energy and account for more than 70% of global CO2 emissions. Transitioning cities to renewable energy, green buildings, efficient transportation systems and reduced waste is key to tackling climate change and transitioning to a low-carbon future. New technologies in areas like AI, autonomous vehicles and the internet-of-things also provide opportunities for cities to optimize systems and improve efficiency.

In conclusion, cities stand at the frontier of the sustainable development agenda. Success will require coordinated efforts across governments, businesses and communities to build inclusive, safe, and eco-friendly cities that provide opportunities and dignity for all. The challenges are enormous, but so too are the potential rewards. With shared purpose and determination, cities can lead the world to a sustainable future.


 Here is a draft article in the style of The Economist on Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities:

Sustainable Cities: Scaling Up Success 
Global urbanization is proceeding at an unprecedented pace. By 2050, two-thirds of the world's population will live in cities, up from just over half today. While cities drive economic growth, this rapid urbanization also brings challenges like inadequate infrastructure, lack of services, congestion, and poor housing. At their worst, poorly planned cities can become traps of poverty and engines of environmental degradation. But with good governance and sound policies, cities can become hubs of innovation, productivity, and culture. 

Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. It calls for access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing, basic services, and upgrade of slums. It demands safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems, as well as participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management. Success will require coordination across all spheres of government and with communities and business.

There are bright spots of progress. Places like Seoul, Singapore and Bogota have made huge gains in public transit, walkability, and mixed-use development. Renewable-energy powered buildings and micro-grid systems are making cities more sustainable and resilient. Nature is being woven back into cities, with green spaces and reclaimed waterfronts. Technology enables smarter traffic systems, water and waste management, and citizen feedback.

Yet overall, the world's cities have a long road ahead to sustainability. An estimated one billion people still live in slums, lacking basics like clean water and sanitation. Air pollution causes millions of deaths annually, much in cities. Rapid motorization brings traffic jams, accidents and sprawl. Poor waste management and planning compound risks like flooding. Achieving SDG 11 will require massive investments in infrastructure and services, as well as policy and governance reforms. It needs a long-term vision for livability, inclusiveness and resilience.

With the right choices now, cities can lead the world to a sustainable future. Partnerships across sectors and at all levels of government are key. By sharing solutions, cities can avoid mistakes and leapfrog to cutting-edge technologies and policies. With strong institutions, good governance and an integrated approach to planning and management, the cities of the future can become living labs for sustainability -- places where people and planet can thrive together. The world's cities face an urgent call to action: a once in a lifetime chance to reimagine and reshape the future, to make sustainability and resilience a reality. The next few decades will determine whether global cities lead us to a sustainable future or into an urban spiral of poverty and environmental decline. The stakes could not be higher, but the potential rewards of sustainable cities are immeasurable.


 Here is a draft long-form article in the style of Harvard Business Review on SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities:

Building the Cities of the Future: Why Achieving SDG 11 Matters for Business 

Our world is urbanizing at an unprecedented rate. The UN projects that 68% of the world population will live in urban areas by 2050, up from 55% today. While cities have long been centers of social and economic opportunity, rapid urbanization also brings challenges like overcrowding, pollution, and resource scarcity if not properly managed.

The UN's Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable." Achieving this goal is crucial for the future of businesses and society. When cities work well, they create productive ecosystems that drive innovation, job creation, and economic growth. When they don't, the costs are huge. By one estimate, the price tag for providing basic services in slums alone is over $1 trillion per year worldwide.

For business leaders, engaging with SDG 11 is thus an opportunity to help build the cities of the future in a way that unlocks growth and prosperity. Four priorities are key:

 1. Invest in infrastructure. Roads, buildings, water and sanitation systems, and energy networks are all deeply interdependent in cities. But the infrastructure gap for meeting the needs of developing cities is over $1 trillion per year. Businesses must work with governments and communities to find innovative ways to finance and build smart, sustainable infrastructure. 

2. Advance mobility. The transportation systems cities choose today will shape development for decades. Shared, electric, and autonomous mobility options, as well as expanded public transit, can improve connectivity while reducing emissions and congestion. Businesses should support and invest in these new models of getting around.

3. Build in resilience. Rapid urbanization, climate change, and resource depletion are straining cities in ways that threaten business continuity and society. Businesses should advocate for nature-based solutions, renewable energy, and climate-adaptive design to make cities resilient in the face of these existential challenges. 

4.Foster inclusion. Too many cities today are deeply unequal, with certain populations left behind without access to opportunity. An inclusive city is one where infrastructure, services, and economic participation extend to all. Businesses must consider how their own practices and investments can support inclusion and community wellbeing.  

With vision and leadership, businesses can work as partners to develop cities that are livable, resilient, and propellants of prosperity. Achieving SDG 11 won't be easy, but building sustainable cities is one of the most significant issues of our time--and one that no organization can afford to ignore. The future of business depends on the future of our communities, so now is the time for action. Together, we can achieve sustainable cities and communities.

The Future is Urban: How Sustainable Cities Can Save the Planet 

Around the world, cities are growing at an unprecedented rate. By 2050, two-thirds of the global population will live in urban areas. While cities have long been centers of innovation and economic opportunity, rapid urbanization also brings immense challenges. How we build and manage our cities will be crucial to the future of our planet.  

Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. This means ensuring access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services; upgrading slums; providing safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all; enhancing inclusive and sustainable urbanization; reducing the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities; and providing universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces.  

Progress on SDG 11 is mixed around the world. In many cities, economic opportunity and access to services remain deeply unequal. Slums continue to expand, basic services are lacking, and pollution poses serious health risks. However, some cities are pioneering new models of sustainable urban living. Urban planners are rethinking transportation with bike- and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. Architects are building eco-friendly housing and repurposing abandoned spaces. Smart city technologies can reduce energy usage and improve service delivery.  

No single solution exists, but empowering local governments, engaging citizens, and learning from successful models can help accelerate progress. Financing for housing, infrastructure and services also needs to triple to $6.3 trillion per year. With enhanced support, cities can implement integrated policies, plans and designs that unlock the potential of urbanization and secure our shared future.

The path to sustainable cities is challenging but clear. Together, we must make cities livable, resilient and just for all. Our planet's future depends on it. With vision and determination, cities can lead the way to a sustainable future for humanity. The time for action is now. Our cities are the future, and that future must be sustainable.

Sustainable Cities: Building the Future We Want 

Our cities are expanding at an unprecedented rate. By 2050, two-thirds of the world's population will live in urban areas. While cities drive economic growth, they also strain natural resources and infrastructure. How cities develop will be crucial to the future of our planet.

Sustainable Development Goal 11 calls for making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. This means ensuring access to safe and affordable housing, upgrading slums, providing access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, expanding public transport, creating green spaces, and improving urban planning and management.   

Progress is underway but accelerated action is needed. According to the UN, the proportion of the urban population living in slums dropped from 46% to 23% in developing regions since 1990. However, in sub-Saharan Africa, the proportion of the urban population living in slums increased from 43% to 55% during the same period. Overall, around 1 billion people still live in slums today, lacking access to basic services.   

Traffic and congestion also remain major problems. UN estimates indicate the total number of vehicles is set to double to 2 billion by 2050, while road traffic injuries are projected to become the 7th leading cause of death by 2030. Expanding public transit and promoting cycling and pedestrian walkways in cities can help address this. Many cities are taking action, for example launching bike-sharing systems, pedestrianizing city centers and expanding metro rail lines.  

Another key issue is providing access to housing for all. UN-Habitat estimates a shortage of 3 billion affordable housing units by 2025 in developing countries. In response, some countries have launched large-scale affordable housing programs. For example, Ethiopia’s Integrated Housing Development Programme aims to construct 400,000 affordable housing units.  

Building sustainable cities requires huge investments in infrastructure and services, as well as urban planning to promote energy efficiency, reduce waste and boost quality of life. But the future benefits are also enormous. Sustainable cities can spur economic growth, reduce poverty, promote social inclusion and help protect the environment. With political will and smart investments today, sustainable cities can help build a sustainable future for generations to come.

Building Sustainable Cities for Our Urban Future

The world is undergoing the largest wave of urban growth in history.  Nearly 1 million people are added to cities every week, with more people living in urban areas than rural ones for the first time. By 2050, two-thirds of the world will be urban. This unprecedented urbanization has the potential to lift millions out of poverty and drive economic growth, but uncontrolled growth and sprawl could lead to increased poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation.

Sustainable Development Goal 11 seeks to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. It aims to ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services including transport, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, and provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible public spaces. Fulfilling this goal is critical to the prosperity and future of our planet. 

The UN's Department of Economic and Social Affairs tracks progress on SDG 11 and finds a mixed picture so far. On the positive side, more people today have access to electricity and improved sanitation compared to 2000. However, slums are expanding in many cities, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Air pollution is worsening, traffic congestion worsening, and municipal waste generation increasing. The world must dramatically step up efforts to manage the growth of cities and make them sustainable.

Regional approaches to sustainable urban development are underway around the world.  The European Union recently announced its "Green City Accord" to make cities greener, healthier and smarter.   Latin American countries are promoting "Livable and Sustainable Cities". In Africa, inter-governmental organizations are collaborating on sustainable growth of intermediary cities across the continent. In Asia and the Pacific, Eco-Cities and Low-Carbon Cities programs are gaining ground.  

Financing sustainable cities will require an estimated $3.7 trillion per year from both public and private sources. Municipal governments need to strengthen their ability to generate revenue.  National governments can incentivize sustainable urban development. And private and institutional investors are showing increasing interest in green bonds, smart city infrastructure, and more. New technologies like AI, IoT sensors, and open data platforms can help cities optimize energy and infrastructure efficiency.  

Our cities are the beating heart of human achievement, centers of culture, innovation, and economic vitality. Making them sustainable and livable is one of the 21st century’s greatest challenges and most promising opportunities. With political will, financial investment, and civic engagement we can build cities that are green, tech-integrated, people-focused and climate-resilient. Our future depends on it.


 Here is a draft academic article in the style of the Journal of International Development on Sustainable Development Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable:

Sustainable Development Goal 11: Progress and Challenges in Building Sustainable Cities and Communities  

Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable" by 2030. This ambitious goal recognizes that cities are key drivers of sustainable development, with over half the global population now living in urban areas. Achieving SDG 11 will require coordinated policy interventions, massive investments, and collaborative action between all sectors of society at the global, national and local levels.   

There has been some progress made towards SDG 11 in recent years according to the UN Secretary-General's annual SDG Progress Report. More people today have access to basic urban services like transportation, energy, and sanitation. Slum populations have declined as a proportion of urban populations in some regions. Many cities have developed resilience strategies and disaster risk management plans. However, the scale of the challenges to build sustainable, inclusive, and resilient cities is vast. Key issues like lack of affordable housing, urban poverty and inequality, underdeveloped infrastructure and transportation, lack of green spaces, and vulnerability to disasters still plague cities around the world, especially in less developed countries.   

The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted how critical cities are to society and the economy, but also how vulnerabilities like lack of housing, healthcare, and economic opportunity can intensify the impacts of crises. As the world looks to 'build back better' from the pandemic, investments in sustainable infrastructure, public services, and a new wave of sustainable urban planning and policy will be essential. Institutions like UN-Habitat, UN DESA, and UNDP have released guidance on how cities can integrate sustainable development principles into their recovery efforts and build long-term resilience. Global partnerships like the World Urban Campaign, World Cities Day, and the General Assembly of Partners are also supporting SDG 11 by advocating for political attention, sharing knowledge, and mobilizing non-state actors.

There are several key priorities that will be important to accelerate progress on SDG 11 and address gaps that have emerged or worsened due to the pandemic. First, increasing investments in sustainable and resilient infrastructure...[continue with several additional priorities and recommendations]. 

In conclusion, while there has been progress in achieving SDG 11, the scale of the remaining challenges in making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable is enormous. With only 10 years left to achieve the SDGs, strengthening political will, increasing financing, and fostering multi-stakeholder partnerships to implement sustainable urban solutions will be critical. Cities that take bold action now to invest in resilient systems and inclusive growth will lead the way to a sustainable future for communities around the world.


 Here is a draft of an academic article in the style of the Journal of Development Economics on Sustainable Development Goal 11:

Sustainable Development Goal 11: Building Sustainable Cities and Communities 

Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable" (United Nations, 2021). This goal encapsulates the increasing challenges and opportunities of rapid urbanization and the need to ensure that cities are sustainable, especially in developing countries. According to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), over 55% of the world's population lives in urban areas today, and that number is projected to increase to 68% by 2050 (UN DESA, 2021). The majority of this increase will be concentrated in Africa and Asia. With the increasing scale and pace of urbanization, especially in lower-income contexts, cities face immense challenges related to basic service delivery, infrastructure, housing, transportation, energy systems and more. At the same time, the density of cities offers opportunities for more sustainable systems and economical provision of public goods and services if properly planned and managed.

SDG 11 sets specific targets related to ensuring access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and public transport systems; strengthening inclusive planning processes; reducing environmental degradation including reducing the per capita environmental impact of cities; strengthening resilience in cities; and providing universal access to public and green spaces. These targets aim to address some of the most pressing issues related to rapid urbanization, especially in low-income areas, and support policy suggestions from organizations like the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) and the UNDP. Despite the challenges posed by low financing for sustainable cities and communities in many developing countries, significant progress has been made towards achieving SDG 11 according to the latest UN SDG reports (UN, 2021).

[The response continues for several additional paragraphs discussing progress, challenges, policy recommendations and examples related to SDG 11...]

In summary, SDG 11 is a crucial goal that aims to address one of the 21st century's most pressing issues: building sustainable cities in an increasingly urban world. While progress has been made, significant challenges remain related to planning, financing and implementation, especially in lower income contexts. A mix of policy, technology adoption and multi-stakeholder partnerships will be required to achieve SDG 11 and ensure that the projected urban growth in coming decades is sustainable and benefits all. Overall, SDG 11 is an ambitious yet vital goal on the road to sustainable development.

Sustainable Cities and Communities: Progress and Challenges in Achieving SDG 11

Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to “make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable” (United Nations, 2015). This goal encompasses a broad range of targets related to housing, transportation, urban planning, disaster risk reduction, and environmental protection in cities. Achieving SDG 11 is critical, as over half the world's population currently lives in urban areas, and this number is projected to increase to 68% by 2050 (United Nations, 2019). 

Progress has been made on several SDG 11 targets, but major challenges remain. On the positive side, the proportion of the urban population living in slums decreased from 28% in 2000 to 23% in 2018 (United Nations, 2019). Many cities have expanded public transport infrastructure, and 95% of the world's urban population now has access to transport networks (United Nations, 2019). However, the number of slum dwellers in absolute terms is still increasing, and many people still lack access to adequate and affordable housing. Urban sprawl continues largely unabated, increasing resource use and emissions. Traffic and transport-related air pollution pose health risks in many cities. 

Local governments play a key role in implementing SDG 11, as they are responsible for urban policymaking, planning, and service provision. National governments, the UN, and other stakeholders support local efforts through policy guidance, funding, technical assistance, and monitoring. For example, UN-Habitat works with over 40 cities in its City Prosperity Initiative to develop integrated urban plans aligned with the SDGs. However, local governments often lack sufficient financial and human resources. Inter-agency coordination on SDG 11 at global and country levels also needs further strengthening.

Progress on SDG 11 is uneven across regions. While some cities in developing countries struggle with basic service provision, cities in developed countries also face challenges such as aging infrastructure, inequalities, and environmental degradation. All cities would benefit from greater national and international support on SDG 11. With rapid urban population growth, especially in Africa and Asia, the coming decades are crucial for achieving sustainable cities. Success will require integrated policies, new technologies and designs, massive investments, data-driven decision making, multi-stakeholder collaboration, and a shared commitment to leaving no one behind. Overall, significant acceleration and scaling up of efforts are needed if SDG 11 is to be achieved by the 2030 deadline.

In summary, although initial progress has been made, major challenges remain to accomplish SDG 11.  Concerted action by all stakeholders at global and local levels is critical to ensure safe, inclusive, resilient and sustainable cities for all. With strong political will and cooperation, the ambitious vision of SDG 11 can be realized.


 Here is a draft of an academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable:

Sustainable Development Goal 11: Progress and Challenges in Creating Sustainable Cities and Communities  

Abstract: Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable" by 2030. This goal encompasses a wide range of targets related to housing, transportation, urban planning, disaster risk reduction, and other issues in cities and communities around the world. This article reviews the progress that has been made so far in achieving SDG 11 based on reports from the UN Secretary-General, UN agencies, and other sources. It finds that while there are bright spots, the world remains off track to achieving most SDG 11 targets and accelerated progress is needed. Key challenges include rapid urbanization, lack of affordable housing and public transit, and increasing risks from natural disasters. The article concludes with policy recommendations to help put SDG 11 back on track.

Introduction: SDG 11 is one of 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the UN in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Its broad aim is to make cities and human settlements sustainable, inclusive, safe, and resilient. The specific targets under SDG 11 include providing adequate and affordable housing (Target 11.1), providing access to safe and affordable transportation (Target 11.2), inclusive and sustainable urbanization (Target 11.3), protecting cultural and natural heritage (Target 11.4), reducing the negative impacts of natural disasters (Targets 11.5 and 11.b), reducing the environmental impact of cities (Targets 11.6 and 11.c), providing access to green and public spaces (Target 11.7), reducing the negative effects of urbanization on human health (Target 11.8), and supporting positive economic, environmental, and social linkages between cities and peri-urban and rural areas (Target 11.a).

Progress: According to the UN Secretary-General's latest SDG progress report, some progress is being made on parts of SDG 11 but the world is not on track to achieve most targets and accelerated progress is needed. Positive developments include improving access to transport (Target 11.2) and public space (Target 11.7) in some regions. However, 1 billion people still live in inadequate housing (Target 11.1) and growth in many cities continues to outpace infrastructure and services (Target 11.3). More than 90% of urban inhabitants are exposed to harmful levels of air pollution (Target 11.6), and economic losses from natural disasters are rising (Target 11.5).

Challenges: Key challenges in achieving SDG 11 include:

•Rapid urbanization: The world's urban population is growing by about 60 million people per year. This growth is outpacing the capacity of many cities to build adequate housing, infrastructure, and services. This contributes to the growth of slums and informal settlements.  

•Lack of affordable housing: There is a massive shortage of affordable housing in cities, with an estimated deficit of 300 million affordable homes according to UN-Habitat. This leads many to live in unsafe, makeshift shelters.

•Inadequate public transit: Many cities lack affordable, reliable public transit options, which contributes to traffic congestion, air pollution, and reduced mobility for the urban poor.  

•Natural disasters: Cities face greater risks from climate change-related disasters like floods, cyclones, droughts, and heatwaves. Poorly planned urbanization also puts more people in harm's way. Disasters can wipe out hard-won development gains.

•Environmental degradation: Problems like waste management, air and water pollution, and loss of green spaces remain major challenges in many cities and have direct negative health impacts on urban residents.

Sustainable Development Goal 11: Building Sustainable and Inclusive Cities

Cities are the epicenters of human civilization, but they also face unprecedented challenges in the 21st century. Rapid urbanization has led to increasing poverty and inequality, poor infrastructure, unsafe housing, traffic congestion, air pollution, and lack of basic services like waste management—all of which disproportionately impact the poor and marginalized. At the same time, cities consume over two-thirds of the world’s energy and account for more than 70% of global CO2 emissions. With the majority of the world’s population projected to live in urban areas by 2050, sustainable and inclusive cities have never been more important to achieve sustainable development for all.  

Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to “make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable” by 2030. This ambitious goal encompasses ten targets focused on access to housing, transportation, inclusive planning, resilience to disasters, protection of cultural and natural heritage, and more. Achieving SDG 11 requires coordinated action at all levels of government, private sector participation, and community involvement.

A key priority is providing access to safe and affordable housing. According to UN-Habitat, over 880 million urban residents live in slums or informal settlements, often without access to basic infrastructure or services. Target 11.1 calls for ensuring access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services, with a focus on slum upgrading and prevention of future slum formation. Strategies include increasing investments in social housing, adopting inclusive zoning and land use policies, improving access to financing for low-income households, and community participation in upgrading programs.

Sustainable transportation systems are also crucial for inclusive, productive cities. Target 11.2 aims to provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all by expanding public transit, improving road safety and integrating transport planning into urban development. Many cities are investing in bus rapid transit systems, pedestrian walkways and bike lanes to reduce congestion and pollution from private vehicles.  

Inclusive, participatory planning is key for responsive, equitable cities. Target 11.3 seeks to enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management. This can be achieved by engaging citizens and civil society in urban planning consultations and decision making and by adopting integrated planning approaches that consider land use, housing, transportation, infrastructure and services in a cohesive manner. Participatory budgeting, where citizens decide how to spend public funds, is another useful approach.

Sustainable Cities and Communities: Progress and Challenges on SDG 11

Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. This goal recognizes that cities are engines of growth and innovation, but also acknowledges the challenges of rapid urbanization including lack of access to basic services, poor infrastructure, congestion, inequality, and environmental degradation. To address these challenges, SDG 11 sets forth ten targets focused on access to housing, transportation, open spaces; disaster risk reduction; protecting cultural and natural heritage; and building sustainable and resilient societies.  

Progress on SDG 11 targets remains uneven across and within countries. According to the UN Secretary-General’s 2019 SDG report, most countries have made some progress on improving access to public transit, upgrading slums, and reducing the risk of disasters. However, accelerated action is needed to meet targets on reducing the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, providing universal access to safe and affordable housing, and strengthening resilience and sustainability. Regional differences persist, with the fastest progress being made in East and South East Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa lagging on most indicators.

Policy interventions and investments to achieve SDG 11 must consider the local context of cities and communities. National governments should establish a framework to empower local governments and stakeholders, but cities must leverage their proximately to residents in determining and implementing policies. Key priorities include: increasing access to finance for infrastructure and services; participation of communities in urban planning; investing in public transit and transitioning to renewable energy; and adopting integrated policies across sectors like transportation, land use, environmental protection, and disaster risk reduction. Partnerships across public, private and community actors are also crucial to meeting the ambition of SDG 11.

While SDG 11 aims for sustainable and inclusive cities, it must not be achieved at the expense of sustainability in other spheres like the environment, climate, and natural resources. Urban sustainability policies should be harmonized with the 2030 Agenda as a whole, and not incentivize unintended trade-offs. With leadership, partnerships, and a systems perspective, cities can be incubators for innovation towards a sustainable future for people and planet. Achieving SDG 11 is critical for shared progress on Agenda 2030.

Sustainable Development Goal 11 focuses on making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. This goal aims to ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services, upgrade slums, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improve road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons. It also aims to enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management in all countries.

According to the UN Secretary General’s 2019 SDG progress report, more than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas, and this number is projected to rise to 68% by 2050. Rapid urbanization poses massive challenges, including growing numbers of slum dwellers, increased air pollution, inadequate basic services, and unplanned urban sprawl. However, well-managed urbanization can drive economic growth and innovation. Greater investments in urban infrastructure and services are urgently needed to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.

The UN Economic and Social Council’s Committee of Experts on Public Administration call for action in several areas under SDG 11: strengthening policy, legal and institutional frameworks for sustainable urban development and urban governance; increasing financing for urban infrastructure and basic services; upgrading slums and providing affordable housing; improving urban planning and promoting compact, integrated and connected cities; ensuring universal access to safe and sustainable transport systems; and strengthening resilience to disasters. They encourage the use of new technologies and new data sources to support urban policymaking, planning and management.

The regional UN commissions including ESCAP, ECLAC, ESCWA, ECE and ECA have programmes and projects focused on sustainable urban development, affordable housing, slum upgrading, integrated urban planning, and improved access to infrastructure and services. The UN Development Programme also works with national and local governments worldwide to develop urban policies, strengthen urban governance, finance critical infrastructure, and make cities more inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Other UN agencies including UN Habitat, UNEP and WHO also support countries and cities in achieving SDG 11.

In summary, significant progress has been made on SDG 11 in some areas like access to transport and open public spaces, but major challenges remain with regard to reducing the numbers of slum dwellers, providing affordable housing and ensuring access to basic services for all. Achieving SDG 11 will require inclusive urban planning, targeted investments, capacity building, strengthened governance and new partnerships. With effective action and collaborations, sustainable and liveable cities can be achieved.


 UN SG Speech 

My fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen, 

We have gathered here today to assess the progress on Sustainable Development Goal 11 - to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. This goal aims to improve access to safe and affordable housing, investment in public transport, creation of green public spaces, and improved urban planning and management in a way that is both participatory and inclusive.

As the world continues to urbanize, sustainable urban development is crucial to the future of our planet. Today, over half the world's population lives in cities, and that number is projected to rise to nearly 7 out of 10 people in the next few decades. Cities are the engines of growth, generating more than 80% of global GDP. When well-planned and managed, cities can drive development and improve livelihoods. However, rapid and unplanned urbanization poses massive challenges like lack of basic services, inadequate infrastructure, unsafe housing, and urban poverty. Traffic congestion in many cities also leads to huge economic costs from lost time, reduced productivity, and higher pollution.  

To address these challenges, national governments, city and regional leaders, international development partners, businesses, and civil society organizations must work together to implement the New Urban Agenda, adopted during Habitat III in 2016. There has been steady progress on SDG 11 targets around the world, but the pace of change needs to accelerate. Some of the key areas that require robust action are:

1) Increase access to adequate, safe and affordable housing: While the proportion of urban residents living in slums has decreased, over 1 billion still live in slum conditions. More investment is needed in social housing and slum upgrading programs.  

2) Expand public transport with special attention to the needs of vulnerable groups: This will reduce air pollution, improve mobility, and provide access to opportunities. However, there is still much room for progress as most cities lag far behind in sustainable transport infrastructure.  

3) Enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization: Urban planning needs to address the needs of vulnerable groups including women, children, elderly, disabled and migrants. Participatory planning and "bottom-up" processes can lead to better outcomes. 

4) Strengthen resilience to natural disasters: As climate change accelerates, cities must invest in disaster risk reduction, especially in informal settlements and for vulnerable groups. Early warning systems and infrastructure improvements are critical.

With innovation, political will and partnerships, SDG 11 can be achieved. The challenge is vast, but the opportunities for progress are real and within our grasp. Together, we can transform our cities into inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable engines of growth and prosperity. Our shared future depends on the actions we take today to build sustainable cities and communities for all.

Thank you.


 UN USG Speech  

Distinguished delegates, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,  It is an honor to address you today on the critical issue of Sustainable Cities and Communities, Sustainable Development Goal 11.  

Our world is urbanizing at an unprecedented pace. By 2050, close to 7 out of 10 people will live in cities and other urban areas. Cities are the engines of economic growth and job creation. However, rapid urbanization also brings challenges like overcrowding, air pollution, lack of basic services and infrastructure, and unequal access to resources.

Goal 11 calls on us to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. This requires improving access to adequate housing, upgrading slums, investing in public transport, creating green public spaces, and improving urban planning and management in a way that is both sustainable and responsive to the needs of women, children, the elderly and disabled.  

According to the latest Sustainable Development Goals report by the UN Secretary-General, progress is being made on some fronts. For example, a higher percentage of urban populations now have access to public transit and municipal waste collection. However, 1 billion people still live in slums, and affordable housing remains out of reach for too many. Cities also account for about 70% of carbon emissions from fuel combustion, even though they occupy only 2% of the Earth's surface. Clearly, more ambitious actions are urgently needed in all countries to curb the environmental footprint of cities while ensuring access to basic services for the most vulnerable.

No country can achieve Goal 11 alone. Regional and international cooperation on city-to-city partnerships, sharing of best practices, and access to sources of finance like the Green Climate Fund are vital to realizing sustainable cities. The UN system is committed to supporting Member States through policy advice, data, and tools for integrated urban planning and finance. But local governments and communities remain central actors in the design and implementation of locally-appropriate solutions. Together, step by step, we can rise to the challenge of creating cities that are sustainable, resilient and livable for all.

Thank you.


 Political Speech

My fellow citizens, 

We have gathered here today to discuss the progress we have made as a nation towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. This goal aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. It is a broad goal with 10 targets and 15 indicators measuring progress in areas such as housing, transportation, cultural heritage, and disaster response.

According to the UN Secretary-General's most recent SDG progress report, more than half of the world's population now lives in cities, and that number is projected to rise to 60% by 2030. This rapid urbanization brings challenges but also opportunities. When well-planned and managed, cities can drive economic growth and promote social development. However, many cities today struggle with challenges like lack of affordable housing, traffic congestion, poor air quality, and lack of public spaces.

To address these challenges, we must take action across several areas:

First, we need to improve access to safe and affordable housing. The UN estimates a need for 96,000 new affordable housing units per day between now and 2030 to meet demand. We should increase public investment in social housing and incentivize private developers to build more affordable units.

Second, we must improve public transportation and urban infrastructure to reduce congestion and make cities more livable. Many cities need expanded bus and rail networks, dedicated bus and bike lanes, and improved walkability. Investing in public transit also makes cities more equitable by providing mobility for all.

Third, we need to strengthen resilience to disasters and the impacts of climate change. This includes improving building codes, investing in resilient infrastructure, creating early warning systems, and educating citizens on disaster preparedness. Resilient cities save lives and money.  

Fourth, we must preserve cultural and natural heritage in cities, which are under threat due to real estate pressure and decay. Protecting historic buildings and creating more public green spaces improves well-being and a sense of community.

Fifth, we need to improve air quality and waste management through policy, technology investments, and behavior change. This will reduce health risks and cleanup cities.

There is no time to waste. We must take bold action in all these areas if we want future generations to inherit sustainable, inclusive and livable cities. Together, we can build the sustainable cities and communities of the future. But we must start today.

Thank you. May we have the wisdom and courage to rise to this urgent challenge.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, in the style of UN DESA targeting an expert audience:

Sustainable Development Goal 11: Progress and Challenges in Creating Sustainable Cities and Communities  

Introduction and Overview
SDG 11 aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable" by 2030. As the world continues to urbanize at an unprecedented pace, achieving SDG 11 is crucial to overall sustainable development. According to the 2018 UN DESA report "68% of the world's population is projected to live in urban areas by 2050." With more than half the world's population already in cities, urban areas are the foremost drivers of development and economic growth, however they also drive inequalities, environmental degradation, congestion, and social challenges if not properly planned and managed.  

Progress and challenges in key SDG 11 targets 
Target 11.1 Housing and slum upgrading: The absolute number of slum dwellers continues to rise, despite moderate improvements in the proportion of urban populations living in slums. An integrated multi-sectoral approach is needed to improve access to shelter and basic services for the urban poor. Partnerships with community organizations and greater investments in upgrading programs are key.

Target 11.2 Sustainable transport systems: Transit-oriented development, non-motorized transport integration, and new mobility services like bike and car-sharing are gaining ground, but private vehicle usage still dominates in most cities.  Significant investments and policy changes are needed to reduce congestion and improve road safety. 

Target 11.3 Urban planning and governance: Most cities lack integrated and participatory urban plans or policies consistent with SDG 11. Decentralization has enabled some cities to develop integrated, long-term urban policies and strategies, but governments require technical and financial assistance to design and implement effective urban planning processes...

[The response would continue for several more paragraphs discussing additional SDG 11 targets and indicators, challenges, and recommendations in a similarly detailed manner, with a short conclusion re-capping the key points and priorities going forward.]


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities in the style of the UN Economic Analysis and Policy Division:

Sustainable Development Goal 11 calls for making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Cities are hubs of ideas, commerce, culture, science, productivity, and social development, but rapid urbanization is also bringing challenges such as overpopulation, pollution, and poverty.  Achieving SDG 11 will require tackling issues like lack of adequate housing, infrastructure, and basic services; growth of slums; increasing road traffic; air and noise pollution; constrained public spaces; increasing vulnerability to disasters; and impacts of climate change. 

According to the 2019 SDG Progress Report of the UN Secretary-General, more than half of the world's population now lives in cities, and urban areas are projected to absorb nearly all population growth over the next 30 years, with 55% of the global population living in urban areas by 2050.  While rates of urbanization are highest in developing regions of the world, particularly in Africa and Asia, even the most developed regions will remain majority urban, including 82% of North America and 89% of Europe.  Managing this rapid urban transition is critical to achieving sustainable development.  

To make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, as envisioned by SDG 11, coordinated policies and investments are needed in areas like sustainable transport systems, green public spaces, improved infrastructure, waste and water management, disaster risk reduction, and affordable housing.  Local governments around the world need support and resources to implement integrated urban policies, laws and regulations focused on inclusion, resource efficiency, pollution reduction, and resilience.  Empowering local authorities and communities and strengthening cooperation between levels of government, the private sector and civil society will be key.

There have been notable efforts around the world to make progress on SDG 11...[The response would continue with several detailed examples and analyses of programs, policies and data to demonstrate progress and remaining challenges for achieving SDG 11]

In conclusion, rapid urbanization brings both opportunities and challenges for sustainable development.  Implementing SDG 11 will require integrated planning, policy, finance, and technologies customized to local contexts.  The next 10 years of action will be crucial to ensure all people have access to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services; upgrade slums; provide sustainable transport; build resilient infrastructure; reduce the environmental impact of cities; and strengthen the capacity of local authorities to effectively govern in inclusive and sustainable ways. Global support and cooperation will be critical to turning today's urbanization challenges into opportunities for sustainable growth and shared prosperity.

Sustainable Development Goal 11: Progress and Challenges in Building Sustainable Cities and Communities  

Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable." As the majority of the world's population now lives in cities, achieving SDG 11 is crucial to overall sustainable development. According to the UN Secretary-General's latest SDG progress report, while there has been moderate progress, the world remains off-track to achieve Goal 11 by 2030.  

Rapid urbanization poses significant challenges to achieving SDG 11. The world's urban population has grown by over 2 billion since 2000 and more than half the global population now lives in cities. The growth of cities has often outpaced the ability of national and local governments to build essential infrastructure and provide basic services. Slums and informal settlements have expanded, housing over 1 billion urban residents who lack access to adequate housing and basic services like clean water, sanitation, and electricity.  

Providing access to safe, affordable, and sustainable housing is key to achieving SDG 11 but continues to be an immense challenge. Current rates of housing construction are insufficient across all regions. In sub-Saharan Africa, over 70% of urban households live in slums or informal housing. In North Africa and Western Asia an estimated 38 million people live in slums. Renters face affordability issues in all world regions. Homelessness has also increased in several developed countries.  

Progress on access to sustainable transport systems and road safety has been mixed. While access to mass transit systems has expanded in some areas, the use of private vehicles continues to grow unsustainably. Road traffic deaths and injuries continue to be a major issue, especially in low- and middle-income countries. According to WHO, road traffic crashes are the leading cause of death for young people aged 5–29 years. Urgent action is needed to improve road safety and shift towards more sustainable modes of transport.  

Integrating disaster risk reduction into urban planning and development is key to building more resilient and sustainable cities...[Additional details and analysis on other Goal 11 targets and indicators].   

In conclusion, while there has been progress on SDG 11, the world is not on track to achieve sustainable cities and communities by 2030. With the majority of future population growth expected in cities, national and local governments must increase their efforts, working with civil society and the private sector, to address rapid urbanization and build cities that are inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Accelerating progress will require scaling up investments in affordable housing, slum upgrading, sustainable transport, smart urbanization, and disaster risk reduction across all world regions.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable:

Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. According to the Secretary-General's latest progress report, while more people live in cities than ever before, rapid urbanization has brought opportunities as well as challenges. Cities are centers of cultural and economic activity, but also often centers of extreme poverty, environmental degradation, and vulnerability to disasters. 

Supporting inclusive and sustainable urbanization is critical to achieving the 2030 Agenda overall. Some key highlights from the progress report show the following:

Access to adequate and affordable housing remains out of reach for many. Around 1 billion people live in slums or informal settlements, many without access to basic services. Homelessness is rising in many cities, especially in developed regions. Housing prices have outpaced income growth in many cities, making urban life unaffordable for medium- and low-income groups. 

Basic services still do not reach many city residents. An estimated 2.3 billion people lack access to basic sanitation, 860 million lack even a basic level of sanitation service, and 663 million still lack access to an improved water source. Waste collection and management remains insufficient in many cities.  

Transportation systems are often inadequate and environmentally unsustainable. Rapid motorization has led to pollution, congestion, and adverse health outcomes in many cities. Access to public transport remains low in developing cities. Investment in sustainable transport options like walking and cycling infrastructure has been limited.

Disaster risk is high, especially for vulnerable groups. Many cities are at high risk of disasters such as floods, storms, droughts, earthquakes and epidemics due to poor planning and limited investment in resilience. Vulnerable groups including slum dwellers are often hit hardest. However, some cities have established successful strategies to reduce risk by integrating resilience into urban planning.

Economic opportunities remain unequal. In many cities, access to jobs and economic opportunity remains highly unequal across neighborhoods and socioeconomic groups. The informal economy provides livelihoods for over 2 billion urban residents worldwide but often lacks security, rights, and protections.

 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 11 targeting an expert audience:

Progress on Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable." This goal recognizes that cities are hubs of innovation and opportunity, but also face significant challenges related to rapid urbanization, environmental degradation, and lack of basic services. According to the United Nations Department of Social and Economic Affairs (DSDG), progress on SDG 11 continues to be mixed, with slowed progress in some areas due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   

On the positive side, more cities are adopting sustainable planning and management practices. Over 9,000 cities and local governments have voluntarily reported on their SDG implementation through the UN Global Compact Cities Program and other initiatives. Many cities have launched resilient infrastructure, public space, and transportation projects aligned with SDG 11. However, the true impact and scalability of these initiatives is still limited. Urban sprawl continues largely unabated, and many cities still lack basic services like waste management, public transit, and safe public spaces - especially for vulnerable groups.    

Key challenges remain around implementing integrated policies, plans and designs; promoting participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management; and strengthening national and regional development planning. According to DISD, least developed countries in particular struggle with lack of capacity and financing to make meaningful progress on sustainable urban development. They recommend ramping up targeted investments, partnerships, and technical assistance to fill these gaps.   

UN Regional Commissions note both promising practices as well as remaining gaps within their regions. For example, some cities in Europe have innovative sustainable mobility systems, while others struggle with deteriorating infrastructure and inadequate housing. In Asia and the Pacific, economic growth has enabled greater access to basic services, yet environmental degradation threatens these gains. Arab cities face challenges around affordability of housing, waste management, and resilient infrastructure.  

Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains an overarching imperative for the sustainable development of cities and communities. As noted in the UN DESA 2020 report, “poverty and vulnerability to poverty remain predominantly urban phenomena...the urban poor face higher risks of being left behind.”  Overall, we must accelerate integrated action across all dimensions of SDG 11 to achieve safe, affordable, accessible, green and resilient cities for all. But this requires political will, partnerships, financing, and a commitment to data-driven and evidence-based policies that prioritize the needs of the most vulnerable groups. Strong monitoring and reporting are also critical to understand where we are, and how far we still must go to fulfill the promise of SDG 11.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) in the style of the UN DESA FSDO division targeting an expert audience:

Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities - A Status Update and Call for Accelerated Action  

Introduction
SDG 11 aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable" and contains 10 targets focused on access to housing, public transit, green spaces, disaster risk reduction, and participatory governance in urban planning. According to the UN Secretary-General's latest SDG progress report, the world is not on track to achieve SDG 11 and its targets by 2030 without rapid acceleration of current actions and interventions. Significant gaps remain in data collection, policy frameworks, financing, and implementation across all aspects of SDG 11 in both developed and developing nations. Urgent collective action is needed to improve the quality of life for over 4 billion people living in cities today and address the projected increase of 2.5 billion more urban residents by 2050.  

Targets and Indicators

To meet the aims of SDG 11 requires action across all its constituent targets, though some targets like access to public transit (11.2), access to green spaces (11.7) and disaster risk reduction (11.5) are critical dependencies for achieving the larger goal. The 23 SDG 11 indicators provide a means of measuring progress but many countries lack data for over half the indicators. Building this data and developing localized indicators should be an immediate priority to enable evidence-based policymaking and identify communities most in need of support.  

Progress and Gaps
Progress on SDG 11 is highly uneven across and within nations. In North America and Europe, most people have access to basic services like housing and transit, yet gaps remain in affordable housing, disaster preparedness, and participatory governance. In Asia and Latin America, urban populations are growing rapidly but infrastructure and policies often cannot keep pace, leading to increased risks from disasters, disease, and lack of mobility options. In Africa and some Small Island Developing States (SIDS), basic amenities like waste management, sanitation, electricity, and road infrastructure require large investments to meet SDG 11. Financing these investments is a key barrier, with costs far outpacing current public and private funding for sustainable urban development.

Recommendations 

As the world becomes more urbanized in the coming decades, achieving SDG 11 will be essential to enable cities to become engines of inclusive growth, social progress, and environmental sustainability rather than amplifiers of poverty, inequality and climate change. Based on the current status, the following actions are urgently needed:...[Continue with 3-5 additional paragraphs of recommendations and conclusions]

Progress on Sustainable Development Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable

Executive Summary
The 2030 Agenda recognizes that sustainable development cannot be achieved without significantly transforming the way we build and manage our urban spaces. By 2050, 68% of the world's population is projected to live in urban areas. SDG 11 calls for inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable cities and human settlements. This report provides an assessment of progress towards the 10 targets that comprise SDG 11 based on available data and reports from member states, UN agencies, and other stakeholders.  

Overall, progress on SDG 11 has been slow but steady. Access to basic services in cities has improved, but large gaps remain in many developing countries. Housing and living conditions have also improved for some, but many still live in slums and informal settlements. Air pollution poses health risks to the majority of urban populations, while limited progress has been made on managing waste and transitioning to sustainable transport. Vulnerability to disasters remains high, especially for the urban poor.

Target 11.1: By 2030, ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums
Over 1 billion people live in slums and informal settlements, lacking access to basic services and infrastructure. Estimates show slow but steady improvements in access to basic services like water, sanitation and electricity in many cities, especially in developing countries in Asia and Africa. However, large gaps remain, and the number of people living in slums continues to grow in some regions due to rural-urban migration and lack of affordable housing. Accelerated efforts are needed to improve informal settlements and provide affordable housing and services for the urban poor.  

Target 11.2: By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons  
While some cities have expanded public transit and improved road safety, the majority still lack sustainable transportation systems that are safe, affordable and accessible for vulnerable groups and meet the mobility needs of growing populations. The global number of deaths from road traffic crashes has plateaued at about 1.35 million per year, and access to public transit remains very low in most cities of the developing world. Transitioning to sustainable modes of transport and improving road safety should be priorities for most cities to address in the coming decade.  

[The report would continue with several more paragraphs discussing progress on the other 8 targets under Goal 11...]

In summary, while there has been progress in pockets, the world's cities remain largely unsustainable, marked by poor access to housing and services, inadequate infrastructure, pollution, lack of public spaces, vulnerability to disasters, and uncontrolled urban sprawl. Achieving SDG 11 will require massive investments, innovation, and political will over the next 10 years to make cities and communities vibrant, inclusive, and sustainable places to live for all. But sustainable cities are possible if we make transformational changes in how we plan and manage urban development. Fulfilling the promise of SDG 11 is critical to achieving the wider 2030 Agenda and sustainable development for people and planet.

Progress on SDG 11: Building Sustainable and Resilient Cities 
UNCTAD Analysis and Policy Options

Introduction
SDG 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. With over half the world’s population now living in urban areas, and two-thirds projected to do so by 2050, achieving SDG 11 is critical to overall progress on the 2030 Agenda. 

Trends show both progress and major challenges. On the positive side, the world has seen increasing investments in public transport, availability of public spaces, and improved waste management in many cities. However, rapid and unplanned urbanization has also resulted in rising numbers of slum dwellers, worsening air pollution, inadequate infrastructure and services, and heightened exposure to climate change impacts.

To build sustainable and resilient cities, five priority areas need urgent global action:

1. Managing rapid urbanization. The world is urbanizing at an unprecedented rate, especially in certain regions such as Asia and Africa. Unmanaged rapid urbanization exacerbates challenges like growth of slums, pressure on services and infrastructure, sprawl, and disaster vulnerability. Support is needed for national urban policies, city-specific growth plans, and sharing of best practices.

2.Expanding access to adequate and affordable housing. There is a global shortage of affordable housing, with over 1 billion people living in slums or informal settlements in cities lacking basic services. Investments are needed in affordable and public housing, slum upgrading, fair mortgages, and affordable rentals. 

3.Investing in public transport and green infrastructure. Mass transportation, cycling networks, pedestrian walkways and green spaces need major expansion to reduce emissions, pollution, traffic deaths and the “urban heat island effect.”  Low-carbon infrastructure financing and policies that encourage reduced car-dependency can support progress.

4.Improving municipal services and infrastructure. Many cities struggle to provide residents with basic municipal services like energy, water and sanitation, waste management, healthcare and education. Additional financing, capacity building and technology transfers are needed to support cities in developing countries. 

5.Increasing resilience to climate change and disasters. Cities are increasingly exposed to climate events like heat waves, flooding, landslides and droughts, as well as disasters like earthquakes. Investments in early warning systems, climate-resilient infrastructure, nature-based solutions and emergency management are vital, especially for vulnerable groups.

 Here is a draft long analytical report on SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) targeting an expert audience:

Sustainable Development Goal 11: Progress and Challenges in African Cities 

Africa is urbanizing at an unprecedented rate. According to the 2020 Revision of World Urbanization Prospects by UN DESA, Africa's urban population has been growing at about 3.5% per year, the highest rate of any region. By 2030, Africa’s urban dwellers are projected to increase to over 800 million. This rapid urbanization brings enormous challenges but also opportunities for sustainable development if managed properly.

Progress towards SDG 11 in Africa has been slow and uneven. Many African cities continue to face challenges related to poverty, inequality, infrastructure, basic services, housing, transportation, air pollution, and resilience to climate change impacts. However, some progress is being made, as indicated by selected indicators for SDG 11:

- Indicator 11.1.1: The proportion of urban population living in slums in Africa south of the Sahara stands at 55.9%, higher than any other region. Some countries have decreased their slum populations, but slum upgrading and affordable housing remain major issues.  

- Indicator 11.2.1: Most African cities lack comprehensive sustainable transport systems. While there are some efforts to develop bus rapid transit systems and non-motorized transit, private car ownership and use are rising rapidly. Traffic congestion, air pollution, and road safety are major concerns. 

- Indicator 11.7.2: Frequency rates of cities that adopt and implement comprehensive risk reduction strategies vary widely in Africa. Some cities have conducted risk assessments and developed disaster risk reduction plans, but implementation is often lacking due to limited technical or financial capacity.

Sustainable Development Goal 11: Progress and Challenges in Establishing Sustainable Cities and Communities  

Introduction

Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable". This goal encompasses a wide range of urban issues, including increasing access to housing and upgrading slums, improving urban planning and management, providing access to sustainable transport systems, enhancing inclusive and sustainable urbanization, protecting and safeguarding cultural and natural heritage, reducing the adverse environmental impact of cities, improving air quality and municipal and other waste management, and increasing resilience of cities to natural and man-made disasters. Achieving this goal requires coordinated action at all levels of government as well as participation of communities and civil society.  

Assessing the Situation: Key Challenges and Opportunities  

The world's cities are rapidly expanding, especially in developing countries, putting a huge strain on infrastructure and services. About 55 percent of the world's population lives in cities today, and this figure is projected to increase to two-thirds by 2050. While urbanization drives economic growth, it also puts pressure on basic services like housing, transportation, energy systems and the environment. There is a shortage of affordable housing for low-income urban residents: The housing deficit for the urban poor is estimated at 330 million households. In many cities, unplanned or informal settlements have developed, which often lack access to even basic infrastructure and services like water and sanitation. 

Improving public transport and reducing traffic and pollution remains challenging in many cities. According to the WHO, outdoor air pollution is a major environmental health problem, with the majority of cities exceed air quality standards. Household and municipal waste generation is also increasing rapidly with urbanization, straining the capacity of waste management systems. Many cities also remain poorly equipped to deal with disasters and the effects of climate change like flooding. At the same time, cities offer significant opportunities for sustainability, including reducing energy usage through efficient infrastructure and transportation systems, and enabling new ways of living and working by clustering homes, businesses and amenities together.

 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 11 ("Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable") in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean:

SDG 11 Progress Report: Building Sustainable Cities and Communities in Latin America and the Caribbean 

Executive Summary: This report provides an in-depth review of progress towards SDG 11 in the Latin American and Caribbean region. It finds that while there have been modest advances in areas like access to public transport and quality urban planning, the region still faces major challenges in providing safe, affordable, and sustainable housing; reducing urban sprawl and transitioning to sustainable mobility options; improving disaster risk management; and enhancing participatory urban governance. Achieving SDG 11 will require renewed political will, innovative policymaking, integrated planning, and mobilization of new investments from both public and private sectors.

General Overview: Latin America remains the most urbanized region in the developing world, with over 80% of the population living in cities. However, much of this urbanization has been unplanned and fragmented, leading to high levels of socioeconomic inequality, segregation, and environmental degradation in cities. An estimated 110 million people in the region live in slums, lacking access to basic services. Meanwhile, car-centric urban planning has led to heavy traffic congestion and poor air quality. The region is also prone to disasters, including floods, landslides, earthquakes and hurricanes, which often have devastating impacts in densely populated urban areas.   

Progress on SDG 11 Targets: 
- Target 11.1 (Access to housing): While new housing units have been built, the region's housing deficit stands at over 30 million units. Slum upgrading programs have reached over 2 million people but must scale up dramatically.  
- Target 11.2 (Access to public transport): Major cities have expanded bus rapid transit and rail systems, but still need to improve accessibility, coverage and affordability.
- Target 11.3 (Inclusive urban planning): Some cities have developed integrated development plans, but participation from underrepresented groups remains limited. Urban sprawl continues largely unabated.
- Target 11.5 (Disaster risk management): Most countries have advanced disaster risk reduction policies and early warning systems, but disaster losses remain high due to weak enforcement and resilience planning.  

Recommendations and Conclusion: Significant acceleration is needed to achieve SDG 11 in Latin America and the Caribbean...[Detailed recommendations and conclusion follow]


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 11 in the style of ESCAP:

Analytical Report on Progress Towards Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities in the Asia-Pacific Region 

Introduction 

Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable" by 2030. As the most populous region in the world, with over 4.2 billion people, the Asia-Pacific faces immense challenges in developing sustainable cities and communities. Over 2 billion people in the region live in urban areas, a figure that is growing rapidly. Unplanned urbanization has led to increases in urban poverty, growth of slums, lack of access to basic services, worsening air pollution and traffic congestion, and increased disaster risks.   

Progress in the Asia-Pacific Region

There has been moderate progress towards SDG 11 in Asia and the Pacific. The proportion of the urban population living in slums in the region fell from 46 percent in 1990 to 30 percent in 2014. Access to basic services has improved, with 96 percent of the urban population having access to electricity and 82 percent with access to basic sanitation services. However, the region still has a long way to go to make cities resilient, inclusive, and sustainable. Key issues include:

1. Managing rapid urbanization. The urban population in Asia and the Pacific has grown by 1.1 percent annually since 2015, outpacing the regional average of 0.9 percent. Unplanned expansion of cities threatens sustainable development. National and city governments must improve urban planning to accommodate population growth in a sustainable manner.  

2. Reducing slums and improving access to housing. There are still at least 230 million slum dwellers in the region. Affordable housing and access to basic services remain in short supply, especially for marginalized groups. Greater investments are needed in public housing and slum upgrading programs.  

3.Addressing pollution and congestion. Most of the world's most polluted cities are in Asia and the Pacific. Poor air and water quality pose major health risks. Traffic congestion also leads to economic losses from excess fuel usage and time wasted. Countries need policies and technologies to reduce emissions, improve waste management, increase green spaces, and promote public transit.

4.Building resilience to disasters. Asia and the Pacific experiences over 70 percent of the world's natural disasters, with significant impacts on cities and communities. Investments in disaster risk reduction, including resilient infrastructure, early warning systems and emergency management, are urgently required to build resilience.

5.Promoting inclusion and participation. Exclusion and inequality within cities, particularly for women, youth, elderly, disabled and migrant groups, must be addressed. Cities should adopt participatory planning and governance mechanisms that give marginalized groups a voice and role in decision making.

SDG 11 Report: Progress on Sustainable Cities and Communities in the Arab region  

Executive Summary: This report provides an in-depth analysis of the progress towards achieving SDG 11 on Sustainable Cities and Communities in the ESCWA region, which comprises 18 Arab countries in Western Asia. Overall, the region faces significant challenges in making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Rapid urbanization, conflicts and instability, lack of adequate and affordable housing, poor infrastructure, and unsustainable consumption and production patterns are major obstacles. However, some progress has been made on issues like increasing access to public transport and improving road safety. Accelerated actions and policies are needed across the region to achieve the targets of SDG 11 by 2030.

1. Introduction: The Arab region is home to over 360 million people, with urban populations increasing at over 2% per year. Nearly two-thirds of the region’s population live in cities, and the urban share is projected to reach 75% by 2050. This rapid urbanization strains the capacity of national and local governments to provide essential infrastructure and services...[A lengthy introduction on the context of cities and communities in the region, key trends, challenges, and opportunities]

2. Progress on SDG 11 Targets: This section analyzes the progress for each of the 10 targets under SDG 11 in the ESCWA region. 

- Target 11.1 (Adequate/affordable housing): Little progress. Over 60 million in the region lack adequate shelter or live in slums. Affordable housing shortage is over 4 million units...[Analysis of each target in depth with data, examples, and details on policies/programs in different ESCWA countries]

- Target 11.2 (Affordable/sustainable transport): Some progress. Several countries expanding metro/public transit systems. But lack of integrated planning with land use is a challenge...    

- Target 11.3 (Inclusive/sustainable urbanization): Limited progress. Weak urban-rural linkages, lack of participatory planning, social/spatial inequalities within cities persist...   

- Target 11.4 (Cultural/natural heritage): Some countries have strengthened protections and regeneration of historic city centers. But conflict/instability threaten heritage sites in others...

 Here is a draft detailed report on Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, in the style of UN DESA targeting an expert audience with a focus on middle-income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities in Middle-Income Countries  

Rapid urbanization in middle-income countries poses both opportunities and challenges for achieving SDG 11 and broader sustainable development. Nearly 90% of future urban growth is projected to take place in Africa and Asia, with many new urban residents settling in secondary cities and unplanned settlements. If managed well, cities can be engines of economic growth and sources of job creation, especially for youth. However, many cities struggle with providing adequate housing, infrastructure, and basic services for ballooning populations. Traffic congestion, air pollution, and waste management are becoming urgent concerns. 

Progress on SDG 11 indicators in middle-income countries has been uneven. Access to public transit and open public spaces has expanded in some cities, but motorization rates also continue to rise quickly. The proportion of urban populations living in slums has declined, but slum populations in many cities are still growing in absolute terms. Some cities have improved solid waste collection and recycling rates, but most still need to improve significantly to reach SDG targets.  

Achieving SDG 11 will require coordinated action across all levels of government and with stakeholders. Integrated planning that brings together housing, infrastructure, transportation, and environmental agencies is critical. National governments need to empower and provide financing for local governments to address on-the-ground realities. Public-private partnerships can help leverage resources, but need careful oversight and regulation to serve public interests. Upgrading informal settlements should focus on providing residents with security of tenure, as well as basic services and infrastructure.  

Middle-income countries will require substantial international support to achieve SDG 11, including finance, capacity building, and knowledge sharing. Multilateral development banks and UN agencies are working to increase investment in sustainable urban development, but resources still fall far short of estimated needs. Partnerships like the Medellin Collaboration on Inclusive and Resilient Cities and the Asian Coalition for Community Action have promoted peer learning on issues like informal settlement upgrading, urban environmental management, and municipal finance.   

While the challenges of rapidly urbanizing middle-income countries are enormous, many cities are developing innovative solutions and demonstrating the potential for sustainable development. With coordinated action, adequate resources and political will, middle-income countries can turn their urbanization challenges into opportunities and make progress toward the vision of safe, inclusive, resilient and sustainable cities for all.


 Here is a draft analytical report on the current progress of Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) in the style of the UN DESA Economic Analysis and Policy Division, focused on middle-income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities - Progress and Challenges in Middle-Income Countries  

Middle-income countries face significant challenges in achieving SDG 11 on sustainable cities and communities. Urbanization rates are rapid, infrastructure is strained, public services are lacking, and environmental degradation threatens public health and economic productivity. However, middle-income countries also have opportunities to leapfrog unsustainable development pathways and build resilient, inclusive cities through integrated planning, new technologies, and partnerships.

Rapid urbanization in middle-income countries demands forward-looking urban planning and policies to promote sustainable development. The percentage of people living in urban areas is projected to rise to 60% by 2030, putting immense pressure on infrastructure and services. Integrated national urban policies, smart city strategies, and investments in public transit can help guide sustainable urban growth. Many middle-income countries still lack such integrated policies, leading to sprawl, inefficiency, and marginalization. 

Infrastructure in middle-income cities is often unable to meet the needs of growing populations. An estimated 2.5 billion people lack access to basic sanitation, and many face limited access to energy, transportation, and housing. Emerging technologies like renewable energy, electric vehicles, and pre-fabricated housing can help close these gaps in a sustainable manner if deployed at scale. Partnerships with private sector and civil society will be key.

Public services in middle-income cities are strained and often fail to serve the poor. An estimated 1 billion people live in slums or informal settlements, lacking access to healthcare, education, water, and sanitation. Improving access to services, while making them more sustainable, resilient and inclusive, should be a priority. Some countries have had success integrating slum communities and providing access to public services, but much more needs to be done.  

Environmental threats in cities like air pollution, lack of green space, and waste management issues require cross-cutting solutions...[additional details and analysis provided for 2 more paragraphs]

In summary, while SDG 11 presents tremendous challenges in middle-income countries facing rapid urbanization, there are opportunities for more sustainable and inclusive development through smart policies, new technologies, integrated planning, and partnerships across sectors. But action must be taken quickly, as the consequences of inaction are severe. With concerted efforts focused on resilient infrastructure, public services for all, and livability, middle-income cities can become engines of sustainable development. But they must act now to shape their urban futures.


 Here is a draft analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), specifically its Development Policy and Analysis Division (DPIDG), targeting an expert audience and focused on middle-income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities in Middle-Income Countries - A Detailed Analysis  

Introduction
SDG 11 aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable" by 2030. This goal encompasses a broad range of targets related to housing, transportation, urban planning, disaster risk reduction, cultural and natural heritage, and more. For middle-income countries undergoing rapid urbanization, achieving SDG 11 is particularly crucial but also challenging. This report provides an in-depth assessment of the progress made towards SDG 11 in middle-income countries, identifying key gaps, challenges, and opportunities for accelerating implementation.  

Progress and Gaps 
According to the Secretary-General's latest SDG progress report, middle-income countries have made moderate advancements towards SDG 11. Positively, rates of urban population growth have declined in parallel with falling birth rates. The proportion of the urban population living in slums has decreased overall. However, the absolute number of slum dwellers remains high at over 1 billion, concentrated in African and Asian middle-income countries. Progress on providing adequate and affordable housing has been slow; at current rates of progress, the 2030 target will not be achieved.  

Sustainable transportation systems remain underdeveloped in most middle-income cities. While public transit coverage has expanded in some cities, inadequate infrastructure and poor connectivity persist. Municipal waste collection rates have improved but waste management systems remain inefficient, with the majority of waste openly dumped or burned. Limited funds, lack of technical skills, and poor governance capacity are key barriers to progress. 

In terms of resilience and disaster risk reduction, some middle-income countries have made efforts to develop disaster risk management plans and bolster emergency response capacity. However, risk knowledge and early warning systems remain limited, and disaster risk reduction measures inadequately funded. In cultural and natural heritage, conservation efforts are constrained by lack of resources and institutional capacity. Progress in sustainable urban planning and management has been mixed; although many cities have sustainability and resilience strategies, implementation challenges abound. 

[The analysis continues for several more paragraphs discussing key challenges, opportunities, and recommendations for accelerating progress on SDG 11 in middle-income countries...]

In conclusion, while moderate advancements have been made, achieving SDG 11 in middle-income countries will require substantial investments, capacity building, policy reforms, and improved governance to overcome implementation gaps and challenges. With only 10 years left until 2030, urgent action must be taken to put middle-income cities and communities on a truly sustainable path.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) targeting an expert audience and focusing on middle-income countries:

Progress on SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities in Middle-Income Countries  

I. Introduction  

Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable." It includes targets related to housing, transportation, urban planning, disaster risk reduction, and environmental impact. Achieving SDG 11 is crucial for development as cities are centers of economic activity, innovation, and population growth. However, rapid urbanization also brings challenges like congestion, pollution, and sprawl. 

Middle-income countries face unique challenges in achieving SDG 11. They have fast-growing cities but often lack the resources and capacity to keep up with needs like infrastructure, transportation, and public services. There are significant opportunities for these countries to "leapfrog" past inefficient or polluting systems and adopt modern, sustainable models of urban design and governance. But targeted investments and policy changes are urgently needed.

II. Progress and Challenges

A. Housing and Slums - The target is to ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and upgrade slums by 2030. While slum populations have declined in some middle-income countries, rapid urbanization means total numbers continue to rise. Government housing programs have had limited success, and partnerships with private developers are still nascent. Slum upgrading and affordable housing require major investment and subsidies to work at scale.  

B. Sustainable Transport - The target is to provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all by 2030.  Many middle-income cities struggle with traffic congestion and lack high-quality public transit and infrastructure for non-motorized transport. Investments have focused on road building, leading to more sprawl and pollution. Sustainable systems like bus rapid transit, light rail, and bike lanes are underutilized but could transform cities by reducing emissions and improving mobility.

C. Urban Planning and Environment - The targets aim to reduce the adverse environmental impact of cities including waste and pollution while promoting inclusive urban planning. Uncontrolled urban sprawl is common, increasing disaster risk and environmental damage. Waste collection only covers 50-80% of the population in many cities. Pollution from vehicles, industry, and energy production reduces quality of life. Improved land use planning, ecological protection, and waste management systems are urgently needed but often underfunded.  

[Continued analysis on disaster risk reduction, public space, cultural heritage...]

III. Recommendations and Conclusion 

In summary, middle-income countries urgently need to invest in sustainable and inclusive urban development to achieve SDG 11...[Recommendations on housing, transport, environment, data collection, partnerships, finance, etc.] By prioritizing livability, equity and environmental protection, middle-income cities can become healthier, more prosperous and resilient places for all residents to call home. With targeted policies, investments and technology adoption, rapid urbanization can become a driver of sustainable development rather than a challenge to overcome. But action is needed now to realize the vision of SDG 11 by 2030.


 Here is a draft lengthy analytical report in the style of the UN DESA Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DSDG) on Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, with a focus on middle-income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 11: Building sustainable, inclusive, and resilient cities and communities in middle-income countries  

Middle-income countries around the world are experiencing rapid urbanization, with over 2.5 billion new urban residents projected between now and 2050.  This pace of urban growth presents both opportunities and challenges for achieving SDG 11 on sustainable cities and communities. On the one hand, well-managed urbanization can drive economic growth, improve access to resources and services, and enhance human well-being. On the other hand, unplanned rapid urban expansion can strain infrastructure and public services, increase poverty and inequality, worsen environmental pollution, and amplify the impacts of natural disasters. Overall progress on SDG 11 in middle-income countries has been mixed, demonstrating the urgency for more coordinated policy interventions and investments to ensure cities are built sustainably and advance inclusive growth.  

On target 11.1 on ensuring access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services, progress has lagged in many middle-income countries, especially for low-income and marginalized groups. Slum populations remain sizable, and access to essential services like waste collection, public transit, and parks remain limited for many urban residents...[Additional details and analysis on all 10 targets of SDG 11 over several paragraphs].  

To accelerate progress, national and local governments in middle-income countries should promote inclusive urban planning and policymaking, increase investments in infrastructure and essential services, strengthen resilience to climate change and disasters, and improve data collection and monitoring systems. Development partners and the international community can support these efforts through technical assistance, funding, and knowledge-sharing on best practices for sustainable urban development. Success will require coordinated action across all levels of government, civil society, the private sector and individual citizens to build cities that leave no one behind.   

The pace of urbanization in middle-income countries presents an opportunity to get sustainable development right, but also an existential risk if not properly managed. With concerted efforts and political will, sustainable, inclusive and resilient cities and communities can drive prosperity and well-being for all. The vision of SDG 11 is within reach if we take actions today to shape a better urban future.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report in the style of the UN DESA Financing for Sustainable Development Office (FSDO) on SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) focused on middle-income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities in Middle-Income Countries - A Perspective

Introduction 

SDG 11 aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable". This is crucial for middle-income countries (MICs) which are urbanizing rapidly. According to UN estimates, over 90% of urban growth will be in the developing world in the coming decades, and over half in MICs. Urbanization poses both opportunities and challenges for sustainable development. On the one hand, cities are engines of economic growth and innovation. On the other, unplanned urban growth strains infrastructure and public services, worsens poverty and inequality, and degrades the environment. 

Progress and Challenges

MICs have made some progress on SDG 11. Access to basic services in cities has improved, slum populations have declined in some countries, and disaster risk reduction strategies have been adopted in many cities. However, progress remains uneven across and within countries. Key challenges include:

1. Managing rapid, unplanned urbanization: In many MICs, urban growth has outpaced the ability of governments to plan and provide affordable housing and infrastructure. This has led to growth of slums and strain on water, sanitation, transport and other utilities. Solutions include urban planning, infill development, and upgrading of informal settlements.

2. Reducing urban poverty and inequality: While cities in MICs have spurred economic growth, this has not always translated into job creation or benefits for the urban poor. Innovative social programs and policies are needed to spread the benefits of urbanization. 

3. Building resilience to environmental hazards: MIC cities are particularly vulnerable to disasters such as floods, droughts, storms and sea level rise due to climate change. Investments in early warning systems, climate-resilient infrastructure, and ecosystem-based adaptation can help boost resilience.   

4. Access to financing for sustainable urban development: Local governments in MICs often lack access to funding and financing tools to make the large upfront investments needed for sustainable cities. National governments and development partners must work to close this funding gap through policy and regulatory changes to enable private sector participation, municipal bonds, green bonds, and climate funds targeting urban resilience.

Partnerships and Next Steps

Tackling these complex challenges in MICs will require coordinated action among governments, development partners, the private sector and civil society. Key steps include: developing integrated national urban policies; decentralizing authority and resources to empower local governments; strengthening municipal capacity in areas like planning, financial management and data collection; and facilitating cooperation across sectors and stakeholders. With concerted action and access to financial and technical support, MICs can make progress towards the ambitions of SDG 11 and build sustainable, resilient cities for all.


 Here is a draft long-form analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) in the style of UNDP targeting an expert audience and focusing on middle-income countries:

Progress on SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities in Middle-Income Countries

Middle-income countries are experiencing rapid urbanization that brings both opportunities and challenges for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 11 on sustainable cities and communities. On the one hand, urbanization can drive economic growth by facilitating agglomeration effects, job creation, and increased productivity. On the other hand, poorly managed urbanization often leads to increased pollution, inadequate infrastructure, and urban sprawl that strains the capacity of cities. 

According to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), the proportion of the population living in urban areas in middle-income countries increased from 43% in 2000 to 53% in 2018. This trend is expected to continue, with UN DESA projecting that 59% of the population in middle-income countries will live in urban areas by 2030. The largest urban populations are in China, India, Brazil, and Mexico. These countries face significant challenges in ensuring that cities and communities are sustainable, inclusive, and resilient as populations grow.

One of the targets under SDG 11 is to “ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums.” However, UNDP estimates that at least 25-30% of the urban population in most developing countries lives in slum-like conditions, lacking access to basic infrastructure and services. For example, in Delhi and Mumbai, India 40-50% of the population lives in informal settlements with limited infrastructure. Upgrading slums and informal settlements to provide residents access to improved housing, water, sanitation and electricity remains a key priority. 

Another target under SDG 11 aims to “provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces.” However, many middle-income countries lack adequate investments in public spaces like parks, gardens, and recreational areas. According to UN DESA, high-income countries have on average 50 times more green space per capita than low-income countries. Lack of public spaces can reduce quality of life and community cohesion in cities. Prioritizing investments in green spaces and making public spaces accessible and inclusive is key for the wellbeing of citizens living in urban areas.

In conclusion, while urbanization brings opportunities for economic growth and development in middle-income countries, managing the challenges associated with rapid urban population growth remains critical for achieving SDG 11 on sustainable cities and communities. Governments and city leaders  must make policy and financial investments in slum upgrading, affordable housing, infrastructure, public spaces and transportation to ensure cities are livable, equitable, and environmentally sustainable. With greater attention and targeted investments in SDG 11, middle-income countries can reap the benefits of urbanization and ensure that no one is left behind.


 Here is a draft long analytical report in the style of UNCTAD on the current progress of Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities in middle-income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities in Middle-Income Countries  

There has been uneven progress on SDG 11 across middle-income countries over the past five years. While some countries have made advances in upgrading slums, developing sustainable transport systems, and strengthening resilience to natural disasters, major challenges remain in managing the rapid urbanization happening across the developing world.

Urbanization rates in middle-income countries remain high, with over half of the world’s urban population now residing in Asia and Africa. However, the majority of this urban growth is happening in an unplanned, haphazard manner. Many new migrants to cities end up living in overcrowded slums or informal settlements, lacking access to basic services like clean water, sanitation, health care and education. Although some countries have upgrading programs for slums and providing security of tenure, the scale of slum growth outstrips these efforts. Providing affordable housing at a large scale remains an intractable challenge.   

Traffic congestion and lack of sustainable public transit options is another issue facing many middle-income cities. While some cities have expanded bus rapid transit systems and invested in metro systems, the majority of city dwellers still rely on private vehicles or informal transit options like mini-buses. This contributes to worsening air pollution, traffic accidents and long commuting times which reduce productivity and quality of life. Transitioning to sustainable modes of transport that reduce emissions and improve efficiency requires major investments that many cities struggle to make.

Resilience to disasters also remains a key problem, as evidenced by major floods, droughts and storms that have impacted cities in recent years, causing loss of life and economic damages. Although some countries have adopted disaster risk reduction strategies and invested in early warning systems, resilience is an area requiring greater global support and cooperation.   

In summary, while there are some promising cases of progress, SDG 11 faces major roadblocks in most middle-income countries related to unplanned urbanization, lack of affordable housing and access to basic services, insufficient sustainable transport and disaster resilience. Achieving sustainable cities and communities will require national governments and the international community to work together through policy development, knowledge sharing, and targeted investments, especially in the areas of slum upgrading, public transit and disaster risk reduction. With coordinated action, the vision of SDG 11 can be realized in cities across the developing world.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Africa targeting an expert audience with a focus on middle-income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 11: Progress and Challenges in Middle-Income Countries  

Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable." This goal encompasses targets related to housing, transportation, urbanization, disaster risk reduction, public spaces, and environmental impacts. For middle-income countries in Africa undergoing rapid urbanization, achieving SDG 11 will be crucial to sustainable development.  

Urbanization in middle-income African countries has been increasing at an unprecedented rate, with over 40% of populations now living in cities. While urbanization drives economic growth, it also strains public services and infrastructure. Providing adequate affordable housing for the growing urban population has proved challenging. Slum populations in cities like Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania continue to rise, now making up 60-80% of city populations. Transportation systems are overburdened, leading to increased traffic and pollution. However, some countries have invested in bus rapid transit systems, like Johannesburg’s Rea Vaya system, to improve public transit.  

Making cities resilient in the face of disasters like floods, droughts, and disease outbreaks is key for sustainable development. Many African cities lack adequate infrastructure and emergency response systems to handle disasters, especially considering the impacts of climate change. Improving resilience requires coordinated efforts across government, the private sector, and civil society to upgrade infrastructure, strengthen public health systems, enhance disaster risk reduction planning, and build inclusive institutions. Partnerships with organizations like UNDP, the World Bank and regional development banks have supported resilience building efforts.

Public spaces like parks, playgrounds, and markets remain limited in many African cities, negatively impacting community wellbeing and commerce. Violence and crime threaten public safety, especially for marginalized groups. Improving security, investing in public spaces, and promoting social inclusion can make cities safer and more livable. However, these efforts require political will and resources that remain lacking in many countries.

In conclusion, while middle-income African countries have made some progress on SDG 11, more work is needed. Coordinating national urban policies, increasing investments in housing, transportation and infrastructure, building disaster resilience, providing public spaces, and improving security can put cities on a sustainable path to development. Partnerships across sectors and with international organizations are key to financing and achieving these complex goals. With political will and cooperation, middle-income African countries can overcome these challenges to make their cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 11 "Sustainable Cities and Communities" in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) targeting an expert audience and with a focus on middle-income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 11 calls for making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. This goal encompasses targets related to housing, transportation, urban planning, reducing the environmental impact of cities, reducing the number of people affected by disasters, and improving urban resilience and sustainability. 

Middle-income countries face significant challenges in achieving SDG 11. Rapid urbanization in these countries has outpaced the ability of governments to provide adequate infrastructure and services. Over 1 billion people live in slums or informal settlements in middle-income countries, lacking access to basic services like electricity, sanitation, and transportation. Traffic congestion, air pollution, and inadequate waste management systems threaten public health and the environment. 

Progress on SDG 11 requires coordinated action across all levels of government and with the private sector and civil society. National governments should develop and implement sustainable urban policies, provide funding and incentives for sustainable infrastructure and affordable housing, and improve governance mechanisms for urban planning and land management. Municipal governments are key actors in providing local public services, upgrading slums, and making cities more livable, inclusive and sustainable.

Affordable housing and access to public transit are priorities for making cities sustainable and equitable. Mixed-income and mixed-use housing developments located near public transit help create connected, livable communities for people of all income levels. Investing in bus rapid transit systems, light rail, bike lanes and pedestrian infrastructure can reduce both traffic and emissions in fast-growing cities. 

Upgrading basic infrastructure and providing access to public services in informal settlements are critical steps toward implementing SDG 11. Community-based partnerships and participatory planning help ensure that interventions meet local needs. In addition to providing access to water, sanitation and electricity, communities require investments in healthcare, education, public spaces, and disaster risk reduction.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 11 in middle-income countries will require coordinated efforts across all levels of government to promote affordable housing, public transit, participatory planning, and basic services for informal communities. With rapid urbanization, sustainable urban policy and governance are urgently needed. Cities are hubs of innovation and economic growth, so investing in sustainable, inclusive communities will have far-reaching benefits for both human and economic development. Overall progress on SDG 11 is still limited in middle-income countries, requiring greater commitments in the coming decades to ensure safe, sustainable and equitable cities for all.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 11 in the style of ECLAC and focused on middle-income countries:

Progress and Challenges on SDG 11 in Middle-Income Countries: An ECLAC Perspective  

Sustainable cities and communities are essential for sustainable development, and achieving SDG 11 on sustainable cities and communities will be crucial for the overall 2030 Agenda. As the most urbanized region in the world, with over 80% of the population living in cities, Latin America and the Caribbean face significant challenges in achieving SDG 11. For middle-income countries in the region in particular, rapid urbanization has strained government capacities and resources to provide adequate housing, infrastructure, and services. 

Housing and basic services remain out of reach for many in middle-income LAC countries. An estimated 110 million people live in informal settlements or slums, lacking access to basic infrastructure and services. While some countries have made progress expanding access to improved sanitation and electricity, access to safely managed drinking water and solid waste collection services remain low, especially for the poorest urban residents. Traffic congestion, lack of public transit, and air pollution pose serious problems in many cities.  

Many middle-income LAC cities struggle with sprawl, increasing inequality, and lack of integrated planning. Uncontrolled peri-urban expansion into surrounding agricultural land and natural areas has been common as cities grow rapidly. This urban sprawl exacerbates inequality as the wealthy congregate in certain areas, while poorer residents are pushed to distant peripheries with few services. Most cities lack integrated long-term planning to promote more compact, equitable, sustainable urban growth.  

To address these challenges, ECLAC recommends the following priorities for middle-income countries in the region:

1) Invest in affordable housing and basic infrastructure for marginalized urban residents. Governments must prioritize providing safe, affordable housing along with water, sanitation and waste management services for all.

2) Improve urban planning and management. Integrating land use and transport planning, limiting sprawl, and more equitably distributing resources within cities can make them more sustainable, inclusive and resilient. 

3)Expand public transit systems. Developing high-quality public transit is critical to reduce the use of private vehicles, lower emissions, and improve mobility and access for all urban residents.   

4)mobilize resources for sustainable urban development. Municipal governments need stronger tax bases and fiscal transfers from national governments to fund investments in housing, infrastructure and urban services. International development banks and climate funds can also provide targeted support.

In summary, while middle-income LAC countries have made some progress on SDG 11, accelerated action is needed to make cities and human settlements equitable, safe, resilient and sustainable. With political will and targeted policies and investments in affordable housing, infrastructure, urban planning and public transit, SDG 11 can be achieved in the region. But greater resource mobilization and more integrated approaches are urgently needed.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), targeting an expert audience and focusing on middle-income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 11: Progress and Challenges in Asia-Pacific Middle-Income Countries 

ESCAP region is home to 4.1 billion people, or 55% of the world’s population. Rapid urbanization in the region means over 2.3 billion people live in cities, a number that is growing by over 60 million per year. While urbanization has brought economic opportunities, many cities struggle with challenges like inadequate infrastructure, lack of public space, traffic congestion and air pollution. Achieving SDG 11 on Sustainable Cities and Communities is critical for the region.

This report analyzes progress and challenges in implementing SDG 11 in middle-income countries of Asia and the Pacific. It draws on data from UN DESA, ESCAP and other sources. Key findings show that middle-income countries have made moderate progress on SDG 11 but accelerated efforts are needed.

On target 11.1 for adequate, safe and affordable housing, the region has a housing shortage of over 100 million units. Slum populations remain high in lower middle-income countries like Bangladesh, though declining in upper middle-income countries. Public spending on housing needs to increase along with private sector participation using PPP models.   

On target 11.2 for access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, the region has seen rapid growth in infrastructure like metros. But per capita infrastructure spending and public transport coverage needs improvement. Developing sustainable mobility through investments in mass transit, non-motorized transport and new technologies should be prioritized.

On target 11.6 for reduced per capita environmental impact of cities, many cities struggle with poor waste management, polluted urban environments and lack disaster resilience. Stricter environmental regulations, investments in waste to energy plants and eco-efficient infrastructure are needed. 

In conclusion, while Asia-Pacific middle-income countries have expanded opportunities through urbanization, accelerated efforts are needed across targets to make cities sustainable, inclusive and resilient. Regional cooperation on data sharing, innovative finance and smart city technologies can support countries to achieve SDG 11. But national governments need to increase public spending, strengthen policy and governance frameworks and encourage private sector participation to make long-term progress.

Sustainable Development Goal 11: Building Inclusive, Safe, Resilient and Sustainable Cities in the Arab Region  

Executive Summary

This report provides an in-depth assessment of progress on SDG 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities, in the ESCWA region with a focus on middle-income countries. It analyzes trends around urbanization, access to safe and affordable housing, transport systems, urban planning, disaster risk reduction, and environmental protection. The analysis finds that while many countries have made progress on individual targets and indicators related to SDG 11, most countries are not on track to achieve the goal as a whole. Challenges around rapid urbanization, lack of integrated policy frameworks, and insufficient institutional capacity and financing threaten to undermine progress. The report provides a set of policy recommendations to accelerate progress on SDG 11.

Key Findings and Progress

 •The Arab region continues to face challenges from rapid urbanization, with over two-thirds of the population residing in cities as of 2018 according to UN DESA. This has strained infrastructure and resources and made sustainable urban planning difficult. While urbanization rates have slowed in recent years, strategies are still needed to guide future urban growth in a sustainable manner.  

•Affordable housing remains in short supply in the region, though countries like Morocco and Tunisia have made efforts to increase access through social housing programs. Informal settlements also continue to expand, indicating the need for slum upgrading and affordable housing, especially for low-income groups.  

•Public transport remains limited in most cities in the region, though some countries like Egypt and Jordan have invested in bus rapid transit systems and rail networks to provide alternatives to private vehicles. Still, the share of trips made by public transport remains quite low, contributing to high rates of air pollution and traffic in many cities.  

[The report would continue with several more pages of analysis and recommendations around the other SDG 11 targets, including disaster risk reduction, environmental protection, public spaces, cultural heritage, and cross-cutting areas like governance, financing, and data collection. Additional details, examples, statistics, and visuals would be included to provide a comprehensive review of the status of SDG 11 in the region focused on middle-income countries.]

In conclusion, progress on SDG 11 in the Arab region has been uneven but most countries remain off-track to achieve sustainable cities and communities by 2030. Concerted action is needed to improve integrated urban planning, increase affordable housing, expand public transport and invest in resilience to put cities on a sustainable path forward in the coming decade. With support from ESCWA and other UN agencies, countries have the potential to make great strides on this vital sustainable development goal.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities in the style of UN DESA:

Sustainable Development Goal 11: Progress and Challenges in Sustainable Cities and Communities, with a Focus on Vulnerable Countries  

Introduction  

Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable." As the world continues to urbanize rapidly, achieving SDG 11 is crucial to overall sustainable development, especially for vulnerable countries like least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) where managing urban growth and providing basic services poses significant challenges.  

Progress in LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs  

LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs face disproportionate challenges in achieving SDG 11. In LDCs, over 40% of the population live in slums, lacking access to basic services. Urbanization rates in LDCs are rising rapidly, projected to reach 56% by 2050, straining limited resources and capacities to provide affordable housing and plan sustainable cities. In SIDS, over 50% of populations live in coastal areas threatened by climate change impacts like sea level rise and extreme weather events. Rapid urbanization and tourism growth have also put pressure on waste management and pollution. In LLDCs, lack of infrastructure and transportation links to global markets pose challenges for sustainable urban economic growth.  

However, some progress is being made. Some LDCs have improved slum conditions, e.g. Togo improved access to non-slum housing by over 25% since 2000.  SIDS like Jamaica have piloted resilient housing for coastal communities.  Cities in LLDCs like Mongolia and Zambia have invested in public transport to address congestion and pollution. Many countries have recognized SDG 11 in national development plans, though financial and technical capacity constraints remain.  

Gaps and Recommendations

Major gaps remain in achieving SDG 11 for vulnerable countries. Affordable housing shortages persist in many countries, with 230 million estimated to be needed in just in LDCs/SIDS/LLDCs. Rapid urbanization continues to outpace the provision of basic services like sanitation in slums. Pollution from transport, waste and industry also remain issues for many cities. Climate change threatens water access and infrastructure resilience in many locations.  

Recommendations for accelerating progress include:

1. Increase investments in affordable and resilient housing, slum upgrading and coastal community resettlement. More funding and technical support is needed.

2. Support integrated waste, sanitation and pollution management programs. LDCs/SIDS/LLDCs need assistance building waste-to-energy and low-carbon transport infrastructure.  

3. Improve urban planning and governance. LDCs/SIDS/LLDCs would benefit from support for data collection, plan development, and municipal finance and management systems to guide sustainable urbanization.

4. Build infrastructure resilience. Investments are needed in water security, drainage/flood control and climate-resilient transport/energy networks, especially in SIDS and low-lying urban areas in other countries.

5. Regional cooperation. Countries would benefit from sharing knowledge on challenges/solutions related to sustainable cities and climate change through existing regional intergovernmental mechanisms and city networks.

In summary, while there has been some progress, major gaps remain in achieving SDG 11 for LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs. With increased investments, improved governance and planning, and support for key infrastructure/services, cities in these vulnerable countries can develop sustainably and prosper. But action is needed now to prepare for continued urban growth and climate change.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities in the style of the UN Economic Analysis and Policy Division (EAPD) focused on least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries:

SDG 11: Progress and Challenges in Developing Sustainable Cities and Communities

Cities and human settlements, if well-planned and managed, can be hubs of innovation and economic growth, supporting social and cultural development. However, rapid urbanization around the world has put tremendous strains on lives and livelihoods, disproportionally affecting marginalized groups in least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries. 

According to estimates by UN DESA, about 55% of the world's population currently lives in urban areas, projected to grow to 68% by 2050. The implications of this massive increase require a concerted sustainable urban development agenda to make cities and communities safe, resilient, and inclusive. Significant progress has been made by many countries in improving access to housing, land tenure security, transport systems, and public spaces, as well as strengthening resilience to natural and human-made disasters. However, accelerated progress is still needed.

In the 49 least developed countries, where 34% of the population live in urban areas, rapid urbanization has outpaced the capacity to provide basic infrastructure and services. Overcrowding, poor housing, inadequate and insecure access to land, lack of transport and mobility options, and increasing exposure to climate change impacts threaten lives and livelihoods. In 33 small island developing states, where 67% live in urban areas concentrated in a few major cities, sea level rise and coastal degradation pose additional threats. In 32 landlocked developing countries, where only 38% live in urban areas, isolation from global trade networks and growth centers has hindered development.

Adequate housing remains inaccessible for many in these groups of countries. An estimated 400 million new affordable housing units are needed globally by 2025, especially in Africa and South Asia. Upgrading slums and providing access to basic services must be prioritized...[Additional details and recommendations provided for transportation, disaster resilience, public open spaces, etc.]

In conclusion, accelerated progress towards SDG 11 in the developing world's most vulnerable countries will require coordinated efforts across all levels of government, the private sector, and civil society. By facilitating locally-driven solutions, providing targeted funding and technical assistance, as well as sharing knowledge and data on best practices, the international community can support sustainable and inclusive urban development for all.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities in the style of the UN DESA Division for Public Institutions and Digital Government (DPIDG) focused on least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS) and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs):

SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities - Progress and Challenges in Vulnerable Countries   

Sustainable urban development remains an immense challenge for vulnerable countries like LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs. Rapid urbanization in these countries has outpaced the capacity of national and local institutions to provide adequate infrastructure and services to growing urban populations. According to UN estimates, over 90% of urban growth in the coming decades will take place in Asia, Africa and Latin America, with much of this growth occurring in secondary cities and smaller urban centers in vulnerable countries. 

In LDCs, over 40% of the population live in slums or slum-like conditions lacking access to basic services. Basic infrastructure like paved roads, waste and water management systems have not kept up with surging populations in cities like Kinshasa, Dhaka and Port Moresby. SIDS face severe constraints on land, resources and capacity to implement sustainable urban plans. Their cities are increasingly vulnerable to disasters and the impacts of climate change like sea level rise and coastal erosion. LLDCs face geographic disadvantage accessing global trade networks and transporting resources, leaving cities disconnected and populations isolated.

Despite these challenges, progress is being made. More than 50 LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs have developed national urban policies promoting sustainable development. Pacific SIDS have set a target of improving access to sustainable transport for over 15 million people in urban areas by 2030. Multiple cities in LDCs and LLDCs have set up bus rapid transit systems, improving mobility and accessibility. However, increased financing and technology transfer for sustainable and resilient infrastructure is urgently needed.

Cooperation on urban data collection and management must also be strengthened to enable more evidence-based policies. Too many cities in vulnerable countries lack basic data on key issues like slum locations, disaster risk, poverty levels and employment rates to make fully informed decisions. Data gaps also make monitoring SDG 11 and other SDGs with an urban dimension difficult.

In conclusion, LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs face unique and interconnected challenges achieving SDG 11 and truly sustainable, resilient and inclusive cities. With global support, cooperation and shared solutions, major inroads can be made, but the scale of the challenge means sustainable urban development will remain an ongoing priority in vulnerable countries for decades to come. Strong political will and accelerated action at both national and local levels can help turn the tide to deliver on the promise of SDG 11.


 Here is a draft analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs targeting an expert audience:

Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable" by 2030. However, many least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries face significant challenges in achieving this goal due to lack of resources and capacity. 

Urbanization rates in LDCs and LLDCs remain lower than the global average but are increasing rapidly, putting a strain on existing infrastructure and services. Many cities in these countries lack basic infrastructure like roads, sanitation systems, affordable housing, and public transit, leading to the proliferation of slums and informal settlements. Access to services like waste management, healthcare, and education are also often lacking in these marginalized communities within cities. Rapid rural to urban migration threatens to overwhelm cities in LDCs that do not have the means to provide jobs, housing, and infrastructure for newcomers.      

The effects of climate change also pose severe challenges, especially in SIDS where sea level rise and extreme weather events like hurricanes threaten infrastructure, property, and even the habitability of some islands. Many coastal cities and island communities need to invest heavily in disaster risk reduction and adaptation but lack the financial resources and technical capacity to do so adequately. Sustainable transportation systems are also harder to develop in smaller island states and in landlocked countries where infrastructure over long distances is more difficult to construct and maintain.  

Achieving SDG 11 will require targeted investments and partnerships to support LDCs, LLDCs, and SIDS in creating sustainable and resilient cities. Developed nations and multilateral organizations need to provide financing, technology transfer, and technical expertise to help build basic infrastructure, upgrade slums, develop sustainable transportation, and strengthen disaster preparedness in cities of the developing world. Partnerships between cities and communities from the developed and developing world can also help exchange knowledge and best practices for sustainable urban development. Overall coordinated action at the global, regional and local levels will be key to ensure no one and no place is left behind in the quest for sustainable cities and communities.


 Here is a draft long fictional analytical report on SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities - in the style of the UN Department of Social and Economic Affairs (DSDG):

Sustainable Development Goal 11 calls for making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. This is crucial for achieving sustainable development, as cities are centers of commerce, culture, and innovation, but can also be places of environmental degradation, poverty, and inequality if not properly managed. Progress on SDG 11 is uneven across regions, with some worrying trends especially in least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries.  

In least developed countries, rapid and unplanned urbanization is straining city infrastructure and services. Over 60% of the population in LDCs lives in slums, lacking access to basic services like water, sanitation, and electricity. Investment in public transit, renewable energy, and resilient infrastructure in LDCs is urgently needed to ensure sustainable city growth. In small island developing states, urban centers face acute threats from natural disasters and climate change, including sea level rise, hurricanes, droughts, and flooding. Building resilience through adaptive infrastructure, ecosystem-based solutions, and disaster risk management plans can help SIDS adapt to these existential threats.

For landlocked developing countries, sustainable cities are key to their development and trade. As cities in LLDCs grow, inadequate transport links to global trade networks and poor transit infrastructure within cities hamper connectivity and economic opportunity. Regional cooperation on transit corridors and investments in public transit and renewable energy can help address these challenges. Achieving SDG 11 in these countries will require technology transfers, policy support, and targeted financing to supplement limited domestic resources.

Some recommendations to accelerate progress on SDG 11 in these groups of countries include: increase financing for slum upgrading programs, public transit, renewable energy and resilient infrastructure; improve policy and governance coordination between national and city governments; promote the adoption of integrated urban planning and design; support technology and knowledge transfers for sustainable waste, water and energy management; and build partnerships with local communities to develop locally-appropriate solutions. With concerted actions, sustainable and resilient cities can drive progress across the 2030 Agenda. Overall, while there is no one-size-fits-all solution, targeted investments and cooperation will be key to achieving SDG 11 in countries with unique vulnerabilities.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, focused on least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities in Vulnerable Countries

Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable." This goal is particularly crucial for vulnerable countries like least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries that often face disproportionate challenges in achieving sustainable urban development. 

Least developed countries (LDCs) are home to over 880 million people, most of whom live in rural areas. However, LDCs are experiencing rapid urbanization, with urban populations growing by over 3% per year. This rapid urban growth is straining the capacities of cities and towns in LDCs, many of which lack basic infrastructure and services. Slum populations in LDCs account for over 60% of urban residents. Achieving basic access to housing, transportation, and public services will require major investments in infrastructure and upgraded planning capabilities in LDCs.

Small island developing states (SIDS) face unique challenges given their small size, remoteness, and vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters. Nearly half the population of SIDS live in urban and peri-urban areas, and this figure is projected to reach two-thirds by 2050. However, the lack of land and resources in SIDS poses constraints on sustainable urban expansion. Sea level rise also threatens coastal cities and infrastructure. Enhancing resilience, improving resource efficiency, and disaster risk reduction are priorities for sustainable urban development in SIDS.

Landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) face geographical disadvantages in accessing resources and global markets to support their urban populations. Although urbanization rates in LLDCs remain relatively low at around 40%, cities and towns have been growing rapidly, by over 3% per year. Poor infrastructure, lack of access to ports, and economic isolation have limited opportunities for sustainable urban industrialization and job creation in LLDCs. Regional cooperation on transportation, trade, and shared natural resources are vital for LLDCs to achieve SDG 11.

In summary, vulnerable countries face major challenges but also opportunities in achieving SDG 11 and promoting sustainable cities and human settlements. With targeted investments, cooperation, and policy changes, sustainable urban development can drive economic growth, reduce poverty, and build resilience even in the poorest and most geographically disadvantaged countries. But the international community must step up support for these countries to make progress toward SDG 11.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) in the style of UNDP:

Progress on Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. This goal is of particular importance for least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries which often face disproportionate challenges in achieving sustainable urban development. 

According to the most recent Sustainable Development Goals Report, the proportion of the urban population living in slums continues to decline overall, but the rate of decline needs to accelerate significantly to achieve the goal. In least developed countries, almost 60% of urban dwellers live in slums, lacking basic services and infrastructure. The COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated vulnerabilities of slum dwellers and set back progress. Targeted investments in basic services, infrastructure, and social protections are urgently needed, especially in least developed countries.

Progress on public transport infrastructure and systems remains slow. Increased investments are needed to provide affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems for all in cities, especially in developing countries and small island developing states where gaps are largest. In many landlocked developing countries, poor transport infrastructure and connectivity pose severe challenges for trade and economic growth. Upgrading infrastructure and improving regional connectivity should be priorities.    

Municipal waste collection and management remain major challenges, especially in least developed countries and small island developing states. Less than 50% of waste in least developed countries is collected, leading to pollution and health issues. Improved waste management systems, increased recycling and composting, and investments in new technologies can help address this issue and create new jobs. Small island developing states would benefit from support for waste-to-energy and plastic waste management initiatives.

Progress on reducing the number of deaths and economic losses from water-related disasters remains too slow. Sea level rise and more extreme weather threaten small island developing states and coastal cities in least developed countries. Improved resilience and adaptation are urgently needed. Early warning systems, infrastructure upgrades, and nature-based solutions should be prioritized, with international support and cooperation.

In conclusion, accelerated progress on SDG 11 will require substantial international support and investment to improve living conditions in slums, enable sustainable transport and waste management systems, strengthen resilience, and adapt to climate change - especially in the most vulnerable countries. Collective action across all actors and at all levels will be key to the sustainable, resilient and inclusive cities and communities envisioned in this goal.


 Here is a draft long-form analytical report in the style of UNCTAD on SDG 11, sustainable cities and communities, with a focus on least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs):

Sustainable Cities and Communities: Progress and Challenges for Vulnerable Countries  

Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable." For least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries, achieving SDG 11 poses significant and diverse challenges due to lack of capacity and resources, vulnerability to climate change impacts, and geographical isolation. 

As of 2019, about 4.2 billion people, more than half of the world's population, live in cities and towns. Urban populations in the developing world are growing rapidly, especially in Asia and Africa. The 49 LDCs are among the world's fastest urbanizing countries, with urban populations growing at 4% per year on average. For SIDS and LLDCs, limited land area and geographical constraints make sustainable urban development particularly crucial but difficult. Urban sprawl threatens agricultural and natural land. Basic services like waste management, public transit, and disaster risk reduction systems are lacking in many cities of these vulnerable countries.

Slum populations in LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs remain high, with over 50% of urban residents living in slums in some countries. Access to basic services in slums is very limited. Unplanned and unregulated construction in slums and other poor neighborhoods poses risks like disease, fire, and building collapse. Many countries lack the resources and capacity to improve slum housing conditions and infrastructure. Climate change impacts like sea level rise, storms, floods, and droughts threaten populations in coastal cities and slums in vulnerable countries.    

To achieve SDG 11, interlinked challenges around basic services, disaster risk reduction, slum upgrading, and climate resilience must be addressed through coordinated policy, planning and investment in cities of LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs...[continue with recommendations, examples, data, etc.]


 Here is a draft long-form analytical report on SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities - in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Africa, targeting an expert audience and focusing on least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 11: Challenges and Opportunities for Vulnerable Countries in Africa  

Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable." This goal encompasses a range of targets, from providing access to affordable and sustainable housing and upgrading slums, to developing sustainable and resilient buildings and transport systems, to reducing the environmental impact of cities including waste and pollution levels.  

For least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) in Africa, SDG 11 presents both significant challenges as well as opportunities. On the challenges side, these countries often lack the financial resources, technical and institutional capacity, and infrastructure to make progress on basic targets around housing, transportation, and utilities. Slum populations are rising across African cities, there are shortages of affordable and sustainable housing, public transit systems are limited, and waste management systems are inadequate. Achieving SDG 11 will require major investments and institution building across the board.

However, there are also opportunities, especially around leapfrogging to sustainable and resilient systems. As LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs urbanize rapidly in the coming decades, they have the chance to build cities and transportation systems that incorporate sustainability and resilience from the start. For example, developing mass transit instead of individual vehicle-focused systems; using sustainable and energy efficient building materials and designs; and incorporating waste-to-energy, recycling and composting programs at the outset. With the support of the international community, including through Official Development Assistance, technology transfer and partnerships, these vulnerable countries can build cities of the future.

To make progress on SDG 11, several recommendations can be made:

1) Focus on municipal capacity building and participatory urban planning...[continues with several more recommendations and concluding thoughts]

SDG 11: Current Progress and Challenges in Building Sustainable Cities and Communities 

While progress has been made in achieving SDG 11 in many regions, significant challenges remain, especially for the most vulnerable countries. According to the 2018 SDG progress report, over 55% of the world’s population now lives in urban areas, and this is expected to increase to 68% by 2050, adding 2.5 billion people to cities. Managing rapid urbanization will require integrated policies and investments in housing, infrastructure, and basic services.

For least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS), SDG 11 poses unique challenges. Many LDCs and SIDS face informal settlement expansion, lack of access to basic services, and vulnerability to disasters.  Providing affordable housing and upgrading slums will require major investments. By improving waste management, public transport and green public spaces, sustainable cities can enhance the quality of life for all.

Landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) also face obstacles in achieving SDG 11, given their geographical constraints and remoteness from ports and trade routes. However, LLDCs can take advantage of urbanization to boost economic growth by strengthening trade facilitation, transportation connectivity, and infrastructure development. Regional cooperation on transportation, energy, and communications networks are vital for LLDCs to benefit from urbanization.  

Globally, access to sustainable transport systems remains limited. Only about half the world has access to public transit. Greater investments are needed to expand bus and rail networks, especially in developing countries. Promoting non-motorized and shared transport options can also help reduce air pollution and traffic congestion.

In conclusion, while urbanization is an engine for development, sustainable and inclusive growth of cities and communities remains challenging, especially in vulnerable countries with limited capacities and resources. Achieving SDG 11 will require integrated policies, innovative financing, knowledge sharing across borders, and investments in basic services and climate-resilient infrastructure to build sustainable and inclusive cities for all. Strong political will and partnerships at all levels are key to overcoming barriers and accelerating progress.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) targeting an expert audience:

Sustainable Development Goal 11: Progress and Challenges in Least Developed Countries, Small Island Developing States, and Landlocked Developing Countries  

Progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 11 on sustainable cities and communities has been slow and uneven across countries and regions. Least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) face particular challenges in achieving SDG 11 targets due to lack of financial and technical resources, vulnerability to climate change impacts, and geographical remoteness.  

In LDCs, rapid urbanization has led to the growth of slums and inadequate and overburdened infrastructure and services. About 55% of the urban population in LDCs live in slums, lacking access to basic services and decent housing. Very few LDCs have developed holistic national urban policies or strategies to address challenges like uncontrolled urban sprawl, poor public transportation systems, and lack of affordable housing. International development assistance for sustainable urbanization in LDCs remains limited. More financing and capacity building are urgently needed.  

For SIDS, SDG 11 is inextricably linked to climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. Sea level rise, coastal erosion, and extreme weather events threaten infrastructure, settlements, and economies in SIDS. However, most SIDS lack adequate resources and technologies to invest in climate-resilient urban infrastructure and building codes. There is also a shortage of data and indicators to effectively monitor SDG 11 progress in SIDS. Regional and international cooperation is critical to help SIDS access funding, technical skills and build resilience.

In LLDCs, achieving SDG 11 targets is hampered by geographical constraints that increase costs and reduce connectivity. This limits economic opportunities, access to resources and cooperation. Despite these challenges, some LLDCs have made progress improving transportation systems, developing efficient border crossing procedures and integrating with global supply chains. Transfer of knowledge and technologies from transit countries and development partners can further support LLDCs in overcoming geographical handicaps to achieve sustainable urbanization.  

In conclusion, accelerated progress towards SDG 11 in vulnerable country groups requires scaled up international cooperation and support through increased official development assistance, technology transfer, and capacity building. Locally, countries must develop comprehensive national urban policies, strengthen data collection, and enhance multi-stakeholder partnerships to implement integrated strategies that address the challenges of rapid urbanization and climate change.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) focusing on least developed countries, small island developing states and landlocked developing countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 11: Progress and Challenges in Asia and the Pacific  

Sustainable cities and communities are essential for achieving sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific, a region with over 4 billion people, many living in urban areas. Significant progress has been made toward SDG 11 in parts of Asia and the Pacific, especially in East and North-East Asia. However, many countries still face major challenges in achieving sustainable and inclusive urbanization, especially least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries which often lack the resources and capacity to invest in basic infrastructure and services.  

According to ESCAP analysis, the proportion of the region’s population living in slums declined from 43% in 2000 to 30% in 2015. However, due to population growth, the total number of slum dwellers has increased to over 500 million. Basic services are still lacking, with only about 60% of urban populations in South and South-West Asia and 50% in South-East Asia having access to safely managed sanitation. Many cities also struggle with inadequate and inefficient infrastructure including public transport, drainage systems, and waste management. Rapid motorization and increasing use of fossil fuels have led to worsening urban air pollution and traffic congestion.     

Small island developing states face particular challenges due to their geographic isolation and vulnerability to climate change impacts like sea level rise, cyclones and coastal erosion which threaten infrastructure, homes and livelihoods. Landlocked developing countries often have limited road networks connecting cities and face high costs in accessing seaports in neighboring countries. Supporting national government and city authorities to adopt integrated policies and investments for public transport, renewable energy, drainage, waste management and urban resilience will be crucial for achieving SDG 11. Regional cooperation on data sharing, policy learning and accessing climate finance and green technology will also help accelerate progress.  

In summary, despite some advancement, major efforts are still needed across Asia and the Pacific to improve access to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services for all and build sustainable, resilient and inclusive cities. With targeted national efforts and regional cooperation, especially to support more vulnerable countries, achieving SDG 11 can transform the region’s cities into engines of growth, social progress and environmental sustainability. But action needs to be taken urgently. Success will depend on mobilizing political will and action at all levels to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.


 Here is a draft long-form analytical report on SDG 11 in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) focused on least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries:

Progress on Sustainable Development Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable

Sustainable cities and human settlements are critical for development, with over half the world's population now living in urban areas. SDG 11 aims to make cities safe, inclusive, resilient and sustainable. For least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS) and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), progress on SDG 11 is essential given the rapid pace of urbanization and the significant risks and challenges faced by these vulnerable countries.

Urbanization in LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs has been faster than the global average, with 2-3% annual urban population growth rates in many countries. This has strained local authorities who struggle with providing basic services and infrastructure. Slum populations remain high, with over 50% of urban populations in LDCs living in slum conditions. LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs also face disproportionate risks from natural disasters and the effects of climate change in urban areas due to lack of resilience. A high proportion of urban populations in these countries remain impacted by inadequate waste management, lack of public transportation, and sub-par road infrastructure.  

Progress on SDG 11 targets has been slow and uneven across regions. While some LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs have expanded public transport, improved waste management and made gains in participatory planning, the scale of the challenge remains enormous. National development plans often lack a strong urban focus. Local authorities frequently have limited technical, institutional and financial capacity. There are not enough opportunities for city-to-city cooperation and twinning. Access to data for decision making and monitoring progress is lacking in many cities in these vulnerable countries. 

To accelerate progress, targeted investment in LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs is urgently needed. More resources should be directed to city agencies to support resilience building, capacity development, and integrated planning. Partnerships with local government associations, the private sector and academia should be formed to strengthen the urban data ecosystem. City-specific support for vulnerability assessments and climate action plans is critical. Participatory processes engaging local communities should be incorporated into planning and project development. 

In summary, while there has been some advancement on SDG 11 in vulnerable countries, the scale of the challenges related to inclusiveness, safety, resilience and sustainability of rapid urbanization are enormous. A greater focus on targeted capacity building, data-driven planning, resilience, and participatory decision making can help create cities where all citizens can enjoy prosperous and fulfilling lives. But without a sizable increase in investment, commitment to policy change and a supportive enabling environment, many cities in LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs will struggle to achieve SDG 11 by 2030.
