Progress on Ending Extreme Poverty Remains Uneven Across the Globe

By The Assistant

While the world has made substantial progress in reducing extreme poverty over the past several decades, millions remain in dire circumstances, and progress on Sustainable Development Goal 1 - ending poverty in all its forms - has been uneven across regions and countries according to a new United Nations report. 

The annual "Progress Towards the Sustainable Development Goals” report released by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs found that the extreme poverty rate has declined from 36% in 1990 to 10% in 2015. However, the pace of decline has slowed in recent years, jeopardizing the goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030. Poverty remains largely endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. Collectively, these regions account for more than 75% of the global poor. The vast majority live in rural areas and depend on agriculture and subsistence farming.

UN officials called on countries to intensify and scale up antipoverty measures by increasing investments in rural infrastructure, agricultural research, universal healthcare, and education. Cash transfer programs, increased access to financial services for the poor, and comprehensive social safety nets were also highlighted as effective mechanisms. These interventions could spur strong economic growth and advance progress on Goal 1 in struggling countries and regions.  

António Guterres, the UN Secretary-General, noted that ending poverty is fundamentally a question of justice and dignity, and achieving this goal would have a tremendous multiplier effect across the other Sustainable Development Goals. “Our shared vision of eradicating poverty in all its manifestations remains as compelling as ever,” he said.

Eradicating poverty will require coordinated action and partnerships between governments, the private sector, and civil society. As countries work to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, interventions and programs supporting the extreme poor and vulnerable must remain a top priority to prevent reversals of progress made in recent years according to many experts. With only 10 years left to achieve the ambitious agenda outlined in the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, ending extreme poverty once and for all remains the world's most urgent task. Overall, while pockets of progress give hope, much work remains to fulfill the pledge of leaving no one behind.

Progress on Ending Extreme Poverty Remains Slow and Uneven Across the Globe  

By Your Assistant

Eight years after the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals, the world remains off track to achieve Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere. According to the UN Secretary-General’s latest SDG progress report, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is projected to push up to 100 million more people into extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $1.90 per day. However, even before the pandemic, progress on reducing poverty rates had stalled in many parts of the world, putting the 2030 targets at risk.  

Ending poverty requires tackling its systemic and structural causes through integrated, coordinated policy actions. Key steps include increasing access to basic resources and services for the poor, expanding economic opportunity and job prospects, strengthening the resilience of the poor in the face of disasters and shocks, and empowering marginalized groups who are disproportionately affected by poverty like women, youth, and persons with disabilities.

Despite the immense challenges, there are bright spots and lessons to build upon. Countries like Vietnam, India and Bolivia have made strong gains in lifting millions out of extreme poverty through sustained economic growth, increased agricultural productivity, investments in human capital, and greater access to financial services for the poor. Basic income schemes and cash transfer programs have also been effective in reducing poverty and inequality in places like Kenya, Egypt and Iran.   

However, for many least developed countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and conflict-affected regions, extreme poverty remains an intractable problem. The UN Development Programme estimates that nearly half the population in least developed countries live in extreme poverty. These nations have been hit hard by a combination of civil wars, instability, high population growth rates, and their over-dependence on a few agricultural commodities and natural resources for export earnings. They urgently need greater international support and debt relief to fund poverty reduction programs and sustainable development.

Reducing inequality will also be crucial for ending poverty. According to Oxfam, the world’s wealthiest 1% have more than twice the wealth of 6.9 billion people. The UN’s overall assessment is that poverty cannot be sustainably eradicated without addressing the structural gaps in access to resources and economic opportunity between the haves and the have nots both within and between countries. Making progress on SDG 10 to reduce inequality is therefore inextricably linked to achieving Goal 1. 

With only 10 years left to meet the SDGs, world leaders must re-double their efforts and work together in partnership to lift the most vulnerable out of poverty and ensure that no one is left behind. Incremental changes will not suffice. Accelerating progress on Goal 1 demands courage, empathy, innovation and a shared belief that ending extreme poverty is possible within our lifetimes. The tools and knowledge to eradicate poverty exist. What remains lacking is sufficient political will and determination to turn words and pledges into impactful action. Bold steps must be taken before 2030 arrives to live up to the promise of a life of dignity and opportunity for all.

Ending Poverty: A Global Challenge and Opportunity 
By Your AI Assistant

Eradicating poverty in all its forms is the first and arguably most important of the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by world leaders in 2015. Ending poverty has been a long-held dream of humanity and a guiding vision of the United Nations since its founding. According to the UN, nearly half the world's population — more than 3.2 billion people — lives on less than $5.50 a day. Close to 1 billion people live in extreme poverty, struggling to meet the most basic human needs like health, education, and access to water and sanitation. 

The quest to end poverty is as complex as it is urgent. It requires coordinated global efforts to boost economies, increase access to social services, develop infrastructure, advance new technologies, empower marginalized groups, and build resilience against environmental and economic shocks. The COVID-19 pandemic has dealt a devastating blow to progress, pushing up to 124 million people back into extreme poverty in 2020 alone according to the World Bank. However, there are promising solutions on the horizon.

The latest UN report on SDG 1 finds that robust economic growth, increased public spending, and targeted pro-poor programs have been helping to lift millions out of poverty each year. Innovations like mobile money are providing access to financial services in remote areas. Access to basic necessities is improving through programs promoting sustainable agriculture, universal healthcare, education for all, and renewable energy microgrids. 

The UN's Development Programme (UNDP) says ending poverty will require scaling up what works - what they call a "poverty proofing approach." This includes increasing financing for proven anti-poverty programs, improving data to pinpoint populations most in need, eliminating discriminatory laws and practices, mitigating the impacts of climate change, and strengthening institutions to deliver essential services.

The Uphill Battle Against Extreme Poverty: Progress on SDG1 

By Your AI Assistant

Despite tremendous gains in reducing extreme poverty over the past few decades, the world remains off-track to end poverty in all its forms by 2030, according to the UN Secretary-General. In his latest report on progress towards the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, the Secretary-General highlighted SDG1, No Poverty, as one of the furthest behind.  

Eradicating poverty in all its dimensions remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. While the rate of extreme poverty declined from 36% in 1990 to 10% in 2015, the pace of poverty reduction has slowed and the COVID-19 crisis is projected to push over 70 million people back into extreme poverty. The economic recession triggered by the pandemic is disproportionately impacting the poor and most vulnerable. Women, children, older populations, indigenous groups, and people with disabilities remain much more likely to live in extreme poverty.

The UN’s Economic and Social Council convened a meeting in April 2021 calling on governments to protect the poor and most vulnerable from the devastating socioeconomic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Leaders called for targeted cash transfer programs, school feeding initiatives, unemployment benefits and subsidized access to healthcare and education to prevent irreversible setbacks. 

However, solutions remain elusive without political will and financing. Donor countries have failed to meet their longstanding commitment to provide 0.7% of gross national income in official development assistance. Trillions of dollars required to meet the SDGs remain missing. The Secretary-General has called for debt relief and restructuring, a large-scale coordinated multilateral response and a transition to renewable energy to set the SDGs back on track.  

“No Poverty” remains a moral and economic imperative and will define the shared progress or failure of the global community. Targeted investments in social protections, basic services, social justice and job creation can build forward better after COVID-19 while ending poverty within our lifetime. The stakes are high, but SDG1 is within our grasp if we summon the will and ingenuity to achieve it. Together, we can eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere. The time for action is now.

UN Progress on Ambitious Poverty Eradication Goals Limited 
By Your Assistant

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal to end poverty in all its forms everywhere is facing major challenges, according to the latest UN annual report on progress towards the SDGs. SDG 1 aims to eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as living on less than $1.90/day, by 2030. But despite steady declines in poverty rates since 1990, the UN warns that COVID-19 is threatening to reverse years of progress.

Extreme poverty rates declined from 36% in 1990 to 8.3% in 2019 according to the World Bank, lifting more than 1 billion people out of extreme poverty. The largest strides were made in East Asia, where rates fell from nearly 62% to less than 1% in the same period, driven by rapid economic growth in China and other countries. But sub-Saharan Africa remains a challenge, with 41% of the population still in extreme poverty. 

The UN's macro-level indicators suggest the world is not on track to ending poverty by 2030. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) reports that based on pre-COVID trends, 6% of the world would still live in extreme poverty in 2030, missing the goal. The UN Development Programme (UNDP) also warns that the rate of poverty reduction has slowed in recent years and is not fast enough, especially given population growth in Africa.

The economic crisis and job losses resulting from the coronavirus pandemic are imperiling the progress that has been made, the UN warns. UN DESA estimates that the pandemic could push 71 to 100 million people into extreme poverty in 2020, the first rise in decades. The World Bank estimates that COVID-19 could push up to 150 million people into extreme poverty by 2021, setting back progress by 4-10 years.

The Moral Imperative to End Extreme Poverty 

By the Assistant

Far too many of our fellow humans still live in extreme poverty, struggling daily for basic necessities like food, shelter, and sanitation. While the world has made progress in reducing poverty over the last few decades, nearly half the world’s population — more than 3 billion people — still live on less than $5.50 a day. That is a stain on our collective conscience.  

Ending poverty in all its forms is the very first of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by UN member states in 2015. SDG 1 calls for eradicating extreme poverty for all people everywhere by 2030. This is an ambitious goal, but also a moral imperative if we want to build a world of dignity and opportunity for all.  

Extreme poverty persists for many reasons: lack of access to resources, education, healthcare and economic opportunity; discrimination and inequality; vulnerability to climate change and environmental degradation; and of course lack of political will. According to the UN, we already have the tools and resources to end poverty if we can muster the will to implement solutions at scale.  

Ending poverty will require a coordinated global effort. We must invest in affordable housing, universal healthcare, quality education, sustainable energy, and other building blocks of healthy communities. We need policies and programs to promote inclusion, gender equality and access to financial services. And developed nations must provide more generous foreign aid and debt relief for poorer countries. 

Poverty is a violation of human rights and human dignity. As global citizens, we should insist that our political leaders make ending extreme poverty a priority. We should support organizations working to improve lives in developing countries. And we should speak up against the harmful stereotypes and stigma that often surround those living in poverty.  

Ending poverty won’t be easy, but together we can build a future in which no one is left behind. Our shared humanity demands nothing less. The time for bold action is now. With compassion and determination, we can achieve SDG 1 and create a world of prosperity, justice and dignity for all. But we must act before it’s too late. Our fellow humans trapped in extreme poverty deserve nothing less.


 Here is a draft Op-ed in the style of Paul Krugman on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty):

The Greatest Moral Challenge of Our Time: Ending Extreme Poverty 

By the year 2030, the global community has pledged to eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, as outlined in the first Sustainable Development Goal. This is arguably the greatest moral challenge of our time. Despite unprecedented global prosperity, nearly half the world’s population — more than 3 billion people — live on less than $2.50 a day. Over 700 million people, including over 200 million children, live in extreme poverty, struggling to fulfill even the most basic needs like health, education, and access to water and sanitation. 

Ending poverty will require a massive coordinated global effort across governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector. We have the resources and knowledge to achieve this goal, but we lack the political and practical will. According to the UN, it would take less than 0.5 percent of global GDP to lift the world's poorest people out of extreme poverty. Yet aid budgets are shrinking, and international organizations remain underfunded and unable to scale up programs to match the level of need.

At the country level, governments must prioritize investments in healthcare, education, sustainable agriculture, gender equality, social safety nets, and economic opportunity. Access to finance, property rights, and inclusive economic policies are also key. Internationally, rich nations must step up development aid, fair trade policies, technology transfers, and debt relief for the poorest countries. The World Bank and regional development banks need to provide low-interest loans, grants and technical support for poverty reduction programs. UN agencies like UNDP, UNICEF, FAO, and UN Women need increased funding to expand on-the-ground programs worldwide.

Ending extreme poverty will not be easy, but it must be done. At stake are the lives and dignity of hundreds of millions of people around the world. With enough political will and resources, we can eliminate extreme poverty, expand the middle class, and promote prosperity for all in a single generation. The time for action is now. Future generations will judge us by our response to this moral imperative. Our shared humanity demands nothing less.

The Challenge of Ending Extreme Poverty by 2030 

The first Sustainable Development Goal adopted by the United Nations in 2015 was to end poverty in all its forms everywhere. Specifically, the targets under SDG 1 aim to eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as living on less than $1.25 a day. While great progress has been made in reducing poverty over the last few decades, we still have a long way to go to achieve this ambitious goal according to the UN's latest report on progress toward the SDGs.  

According to the World Bank, the number of people living in extreme poverty declined from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 736 million in 2015. However, the majority of the world's poor now live in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. To end extreme poverty in all its dimensions, we must focus efforts on the places and groups left behind. The Secretary-General's SDG report notes the uneven progress, and calls on countries to strengthen policies and social protections, increase public spending on essential services, and support livelihoods and jobs especially in areas of conflict or climate change impacts.

Women also continue to face higher rates of poverty, earning less, owning fewer assets, and taking on disproportionate shares of unpaid care work. Discrimination and lack of access to opportunities mean women remain at higher risk of poverty. To achieve SDG 1, we must adopt targeted measures to promote gender equality and women's empowerment. No one can be left behind. 

While economic growth remains crucial, poverty eradication requires more holistic, coordinated and context-specific policies. Countries must strengthen their social protection systems, universalize access to public services, increase domestic resource mobilization, and align policies to benefit the poorest. The UN's regional economic commissions have called for transformative policy changes, including progressive taxation, financial inclusion, sustainable energy, and resilient infrastructure to catalyze job creation and productivity. South-South cooperation on technology transfer and policy coordination is also key.  

In conclusion, we have made substantial progress on poverty reduction, but accelerating gains among disadvantaged groups and in fragile contexts is critical to ending extreme poverty in all its forms by 2030. Achieving SDG 1 will require an all-hands-on-deck approach with greater cooperation and political will across borders and sectors. With only 10 years left, now is the time for bold action guided by our shared commitment to leave no one behind. Our future depends on the choices we make today. Together, we can end poverty.

Eradicating Extreme Poverty: Progress and Challenges on the First Sustainable Development Goal  

The first of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted in 2015 is to "end poverty in all its forms everywhere" by 2030. This broad and ambitious goal aims to eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.90 a day. According to the UN, as of 2019, nearly half of the world's population live in poverty, and over 700 million people live in extreme poverty.  

Progress is being made but not fast enough. The overall proportion of people living in extreme poverty declined from 36% in 1990 to 10% in 2015. However, due to population growth, the total number of people in extreme poverty has declined more slowly. The majority of the extreme poor now live in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. Poverty also increasingly has a rural face, as most of the extreme poor live in rural areas and depend on agriculture for their livelihoods.  

The root causes of poverty are complex and multidimensional. They include lack of income and resources, as well as unequal access to basic services and lack of social protections. Poverty prevents people from realizing their full potential and participating fully in society. It often exists alongside other deprivations like hunger, poor health, and lack of education.

The strategies to achieve SDG 1 involve promoting inclusive economic growth, increasing access to basic resources and social services, and building resilience. Key actions include increasing domestic resource mobilization to fund social programs, providing universal access to basic services like healthcare and education, implementing social protection systems including cash transfers and unemployment benefits, increasing agricultural productivity and rural development, promoting gender equality and empowering women, and facilitating migration and remittances. 

Progress on SDG 1 is uneven across and within countries. Urgent investments are needed to fight extreme poverty, especially in least developed countries and fragile states. With growing inequality, climate change impacts and health crises like COVID-19, declining poverty rates may stall or reverse without intensified efforts. Achieving SDG 1 will require global cooperation, political will and targeted investments to ensure that the ambitious goal of ending extreme poverty can be achieved within the next decade. Overall, the world has the resources and knowledge to eradicate extreme poverty, but bold actions will be needed to overcome the many challenges ahead.


 Here is a draft long-form article in the style of Harvard Business Review on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty):

Ending Extreme Poverty: A Business Imperative for Shared Prosperity

Extreme poverty continues to be one of the greatest challenges facing humanity today. According to the United Nations, nearly 800 million people live in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $1.90 per day. Eradicating extreme poverty is critical not just for the wellbeing of individuals and communities but also for global political and economic stability. 

Sustainable Development Goal 1 calls for an end to poverty in all its forms everywhere. This means reducing at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions by 2030. Achieving this goal will require coordinated action across governments, civil society, and the private sector to promote inclusive economic growth, increase access to resources and basic services, and support communities affected by conflict and climate change.

Ending poverty will fuel a virtuous cycle of inclusive growth and open up new market opportunities. Individuals lifted out of extreme poverty will spend their increased income on basic necessities like food, housing, and transportation, stimulating local economic activity. They will also invest in the health, education, and wellbeing of their children, building human capital for future generations. Over time, this creates a growing middle class of consumers and a more skilled workforce.

For businesses, this means new customers and a wider pool of talent. Many companies are already innovating to serve base-of-the-pyramid consumers in emerging markets, developing affordable products and services tailored to local needs. By understanding and gaining the trust of underserved communities, companies can gain first-mover advantage and build brand loyalty as more people rise out of poverty. Investing in workforce training and skills development also helps ensure a pipeline of qualified employees as economies and labor markets mature.

[The response continues with additional details on challenges related to ending extreme poverty, actions taken by the UN and partners, the role of businesses and investors, and calls for accelerated action to achieve SDG 1.]

The Ambitious Goal to End Extreme Poverty by 2030

By Your Assistant  

In 2015, the 193 member states of the United Nations unanimously adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development featuring 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aimed at ending poverty, protecting the planet and ensuring peace and prosperity for all. The first and foremost goal is to "end poverty in all its forms everywhere" by 2030.  

This bold goal aims to eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as living on less than $1.90 a day. According to the UN, nearly half the world's population — more than 3 billion people — live on less than $2.50 a day. The majority of the extremely poor live in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. Ending poverty will require global cooperation to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning opportunities for all, as well as access to affordable, clean energy for all.   

The key to ending poverty is promoting inclusive economic growth, employment and decent work. Investing in people through healthcare, education, skills training and social protections also plays a significant role, as it enables individuals to reach their full potential and strengthens the overall economy. Access to resources and economic opportunity can substantially reduce poverty rates. Countries must focus on poorest and most vulnerable groups first.

While the world has made tremendous progress in reducing poverty, global poverty remains a persistent challenge. According to the UN, between 1990 and 2015, more than 1 billion people rose above the extreme poverty threshold. However, due to population growth, as well as the COVID-19 crisis, as many as 124 million people have been plunged back into extreme poverty in 2020 alone according to World Bank estimates. 

With only 10 years left to achieve this goal, countries and stakeholders must accelerate action. Success will require mobilizing more financial resources, reallocating existing resources, and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of those resources. It will also need new partnerships, especially with the private sector, and reliable data and evidence to guide policies and investments. Ending poverty will be humanity’s greatest achievement - but the clock is ticking. With political will and global cooperation, an end to extreme poverty can become reality. But the world must act now. Time is running out.


 Here is a draft Forbes-style article on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty):

Ending Extreme Poverty: A Global Priority and Challenge 

Extreme poverty continues to be an urgent global challenge and priority according to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 1 calls for the eradication of extreme poverty for all people everywhere by 2030. According to the UN, extreme poverty is defined as living on less than $1.90 per day. Despite progress, there were still 736 million people, or about 10% of the world's population, living in extreme poverty in 2015. 

Ending extreme poverty will require global cooperation and targeted action. The UN's SDG strategy outlines steps to strengthen social protections, build resilience, and expand access to basic resources and services. Key steps include implementing social protection programs, increasing access to basic resources, expanding financial inclusion, and supporting marginalized communities. 

The UN Development Programme (UNDP) has several initiatives aimed at ending poverty through job creation, entrepreneurship support, and universal healthcare and education access. The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) also aims to help least developed countries escape from poverty through trade, investment, finance, and technology. Regional UN commissions in Africa, Latin America, Asia, the Pacific, Western Asia, and Europe also work to address poverty challenges specific to their areas.

While global extreme poverty rates have declined substantially from 36% in 1990, poverty remains disproportionately high in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Factors like lack of education, gender inequality, weak institutions, environmental degradation, and lack of infrastructure pose major challenges. Fragility and conflict also remain obstacles, as poverty rates are often highest in fragile and conflict-affected states.

Overall, SDG 1 is a critical goal, but also faces immense challenges given the depth and scope of extreme poverty across the world. Success will require cooperation among governments, international organizations, the private sector, and civil society to enact policy changes, strengthen social programs, foster economic growth, and make long-term investments in people and communities. By taking action together, the world can work to fulfill the promise of eliminating extreme poverty for future generations. But we have a long road ahead to achieve this ambitious goal by 2030.

The Uphill Battle Against Extreme Poverty 
By Your Assistant

Eradicating extreme poverty remains an elusive goal that the world is still far from achieving. According to the UN's latest estimates, nearly 800 million people, or about 10% of the world's population, still live in extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $1.90 per day. While the world has made progress in reducing poverty rates, especially since the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, the harsh reality is that poverty persists in many forms across the globe. 

The good news is that before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the global poverty rate had declined to the lowest levels in history. In 1990, nearly 40% of the world's population lived in extreme poverty. Thanks to strong economic growth in developing countries like China and India, that rate was cut by more than half to 16% in just 15 years. However, economic growth alone has not been enough. Targeted interventions by governments, UN agencies, and non-profits have also been critical. Programs like conditional cash transfers, microfinance, and investments in education and healthcare have lifted millions out of poverty.

Despite this progress, the poorest of the poor remain the hardest to reach. Poverty remains endemic in Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia and Latin America. Conflicts, disasters, and climate change continue to undermine poverty eradication efforts. The UN has called for "universal" social protection systems to provide basic income security for the poor and vulnerable. But in low-income countries, only about 20% of the population benefits from any form of social protection. 

The economic crisis caused by COVID-19 has dealt a devastating blow to the world's poorest. By 2021, it's estimated that the pandemic could push nearly 70 million people into extreme poverty. The progress of the past few decades hangs in the balance. Winning the uphill battle against poverty will require global cooperation on an unprecedented scale. Forging ahead with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has never been more crucial to society's collective progress. Overcoming today's setbacks and eliminating extreme poverty is within our reach if the world's nations collectively marshal their forces like never before. The deadline is approaching fast, but for those still struggling in abject poverty each day without progress feels like an eternity. Urgent action is needed to secure their basic needs and dignity. With compassion and perseverance, we can uplift humanity's most vulnerable members and fulfill the promise of SDG 1.


 Here is a draft of an academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the Journal of International Development:

Progress and Challenges in Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 1: No Poverty  

Sustainable Development Goal 1 aims to "end poverty in all its forms everywhere" by 2030. This is an ambitious goal that will require multifaceted and coordinated efforts across the development community. According to the Secretary-General's 2019 SDG progress report, although extreme poverty rates have declined over the past 25 years, as of 2019, nearly half the world's population still lacks access to essential health services and 10% of the world's population still lives on less than $1.90 per day. Significant challenges remain to achieve the targets under SDG 1.

Target 1.1 focuses on eradicating extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.90 per day. According to the World Bank, the extreme poverty rate declined from 36% in 1990 to 10% in 2015. However, due to population growth, the number of people in extreme poverty remained unchanged at approximately 736 million. Poverty remains a rural phenomenon, with extreme poverty rates up to three times higher in rural areas compared to urban areas. Achieving target 1.1 will require targeted investments and policies for sustainable economic growth, social protection, poverty reduction and empowerment of the poor, especially women. 

Target 1.2 focuses on reducing at least by half the proportion of men, women and children living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions by 2030. This will require country-specific poverty measures and policies. Poverty manifests itself in many dimensions beyond income, including lack of access to healthcare, education, housing, and social protection. Policies should take a multidimensional view of poverty using metrics such as the UNDP's Multidimensional Poverty Index.

[The response continues with several more paragraphs on other targets under SDG 1, challenges in measuring and monitoring this goal, role of partnerships, and policy recommendations to accelerate progress.]

In summary, while extreme poverty rates have declined globally, poverty remains a severe problem that disproportionately impacts vulnerable groups in least developed countries and rural areas. Achieving SDG 1 will require global partnerships, targeted investments, and multidimensional poverty reduction strategies to ensure that the poorest and most vulnerable people have access to essential services and more inclusive growth. With only 10 years left to achieve the SDGs, accelerating progress on Goal 1 is critical to improving lives and reaching those furthest behind.


 Here is a draft academic article in the style of the Journal of Development Economics on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty):

Ending Poverty in All its Forms: Progress and Challenges in Achieving SDG 1  

Abstract: Sustainable Development Goal 1 aims to end poverty in all its forms everywhere by 2030. This ambitious goal encompasses targets related to eradicating extreme poverty, reducing poverty in all dimensions, implementing social protection systems, ensuring equal rights to economic resources, and building resilience of the poor. While progress has been made on some targets, the world is not on track to end poverty by 2030. This paper reviews the global progress on SDG 1 based on the latest data and reports from the UN DESA, UNDP, World Bank and others. It finds that while extreme poverty has declined, pockets of extreme poverty remain in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Income inequality has risen within many countries, and more than 70% of people live without social protections. Discrimination and lack of access to resources prevent many from escaping poverty. To achieve SDG 1, the paper argues that policies must promote inclusive economic growth, increase investments in social services, expand social protection coverage, tackle inequality and discrimination, support livelihoods and jobs for the poor, build resilience, and strengthen data availability and monitoring systems.  

Since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda in 2015, the world has made progress in reducing poverty in some dimensions, but not at a rate that will end poverty in all its forms according to SDG 1. The COVID-19 pandemic is projected to reverse years of progress, pushing an estimated 71 million into extreme poverty in 2020 (World Bank 2020). Poverty remains disproportionately high in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where most of the world's poor now reside (UNDP 2020). 

Income poverty remains widespread, with 10% of the world's population living on less than $1.90/day in 2015 (World Bank 2020)...[The article would continue with several pages discussing the indicators and targets under SDG 1 in detail, reviewing progress and challenges, and suggesting policy recommendations and pathways to achieve the goal.]

In conclusion, while progress has been achieved in reducing some aspects of poverty over the past decades, poverty in all its dimensions remains a persistent challenge, exacerbated by new threats like climate change and COVID-19. Achieving SDG 1 will require increased political will, financing, and policies that promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, expand social protections, tackle inequality and discrimination, support livelihoods and jobs for the poor, build resilience, and strengthen data availability to leave no one behind. With a decade left until 2030, now is the time for bold action to end poverty once and for all.

Sustainable Development Goal 1: Progress and Challenges in Ending Poverty  

The first Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) aims to “End poverty in all its forms everywhere” by 2030. This ambitious goal encompasses targets around eradicating extreme poverty, reducing relative poverty, implementing social protection systems, ensuring equal access to resources and basic services, building resilience of the poor, and supporting vulnerable populations. According to the UN Secretary-General’s 2019 SDG report, the world has seen substantial progress in reducing poverty over the past decades. The extreme poverty rate has declined from 36% in 1990 to 10% in 2015. However, 736 million people still live in extreme poverty and face severe deprivation of resources and dignity. Poverty remains an overwhelmingly rural and gendered phenomenon, and conflict and climate change are contributing to rising poverty in some areas. 

To achieve SDG 1, coordinated global efforts are needed to strengthen the productive capacities of the poor, increase access to essential resources and services, and build resilience against shocks and crises. Member states have committed to implementing nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, to provide universal health coverage and end hunger. However, public spending on essential services and social protection remains low in many developing countries. Domestic resource mobilization and official development assistance need to be increased to expand the fiscal space for investments in poverty eradication and universal social protection.   

At the same time, we must recognize that income poverty alone does not fully capture the multiple dimensions of poverty and deprivation. SDG 1 aims for an end to poverty “in all its forms,” calling for a multidimensional approach that addresses lack of access to healthcare, education, housing, and economic and social rights. Structural barriers related to inequality, marginalization and discrimination must also be overcome through targeted interventions and by addressing the root causes of poverty for vulnerable groups including women, youth, indigenous peoples, and persons with disabilities.  

In conclusion, while extreme poverty has declined globally, poverty in all its dimensions remains a pressing challenge, exacerbated by conflict, climate change and inequality. Achieving SDG 1 will require coordinated global actions to strengthen social protection, increase public spending, improve productive capacities, and empower marginalized groups. The Review of Development Economics aims to shed light on innovative policies and programs to help the global community deliver on the promise to leave no one behind.

Sustainable Development Goal 1: Ending Poverty in All its Forms Everywhere 

Abstract: Sustainable Development Goal 1 aims to end poverty in all its forms by 2030. This is an ambitious goal given that over 700 million people still live in extreme poverty. This article reviews the global progress on SDG 1 based on the indicators and targets outlined by the United Nations, with a focus on trends from the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2019 and World Economic Situation and Prospects 2019. The article finds that while extreme poverty has declined, progress has been uneven across regions and countries. Significant challenges remain to eradicate poverty in all its dimensions, including increasing inequality, conflict, and climate change impacts. Achieving SDG 1 will require increased financing, multidimensional poverty assessments, and integrated policies that can lift the most vulnerable groups out of poverty in a sustainable manner.  

Global extreme poverty continues to decline but at a slowing pace. According to the World Bank, the global extreme poverty rate fell to 8.6% in 2018, down from 10% in 2015 and 36% in 1990. This means that nearly 1.9 billion people have risen out of extreme poverty in the last 3 decades. However, the pace of poverty reduction has slowed in recent years, jeopardizing the goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030 (SDG 1.1). The COVID-19 crisis is projected to push over 70 million into extreme poverty, exacerbating an already slowing trend (United Nations 2020).

Progress in reducing poverty has been uneven across regions. Extreme poverty remains disproportionately concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, home to 84% of the extremely poor. While extreme poverty in East Asia and the Pacific declined rapidly from over 60% in 1990 to less than 3% in 2018, the rate in sub-Saharan Africa declined only modestly from 54% to 42% over the same period (World Bank 2020). Poverty tends to be higher in rural areas, conflict settings, and among marginalized groups like women, ethnic minorities, migrants, and persons with disabilities.Vulnerable employment also remains high at 42% in developing countries, with limited social protections (United Nations 2020).  

[The article would continue with several more paragraphs discussing multidimensional poverty, challenges to ending poverty, policy recommendations, and a conclusion.]


 Here is a draft academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the World Development journal:

Progress and Challenges in Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 1: No Poverty   

Sustainable Development Goal 1 aims to "End poverty in all its forms everywhere" by 2030. This ambitious goal encompasses targets around eradicating extreme poverty, implementing social protection systems, ensuring equal rights to resources and basic services, building resilience, and promoting development in the least developed countries. According to the UN Secretary-General's 2019 SDG report, while extreme poverty rates have declined globally, "progress has been uneven and 1.3 billion people still live in multidimensional poverty." Significant challenges remain to achieve SDG 1.

Extreme poverty rates have declined substantially in recent decades, falling from 36% in 1990 to approximately 10% in 2015 according to the World Bank. However, the pace of extreme poverty reduction has slowed, and extreme poverty remains disproportionately high in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Rural populations, children, people with disabilities, and other marginalized groups are most affected. The COVID-19 pandemic is projected to push tens of millions back into extreme poverty, underscoring the fragility of gains made. 

Achieving SDG 1 requires holistic policy approaches that address the systemic and root causes of poverty. This includes increasing access to basic services like healthcare, education, housing, and social protection for vulnerable groups. It also requires policies promoting inclusive economic growth, job creation, and sustainable livelihoods. Targeted programs are needed to reach those furthest behind. 

Financing SDG 1 remains a key challenge, especially in least developed countries with limited domestic resources and weak institutions. While official development assistance remains crucial, recipients need greater ownership over priority setting and allocation of resources. Private sector investment and public-private partnerships should be increasingly leveraged, with appropriate safeguards and oversight.

In conclusion, while gains have been made in reducing extreme poverty, progress on SDG 1 remains uneven and fragile. Multidimensional poverty persists, and new threats like climate change and pandemics threaten to derail progress. Achieving SDG 1 will require political will, partnerships, localized policy approaches, increased financing, and a recommitment to reach the furthest behind. With just over a decade left until 2030, greater urgency is needed to end poverty in all its dimensions. Overall progress remains possible but challenging. Sustained effort across sectors is critical to deliver on the promise of leaving no one behind.


 Here is a draft of a long academic article in the style of the World Bank Economic Review on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty):

Ending extreme poverty: Progress and challenges in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 1  

Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) aims to "end poverty in all its forms everywhere" by 2030. This goal is focused on eradicating extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.90 a day. SDG 1 also aims to ensure basic human needs and give equal access to resources and technology for vulnerable populations.   

Significant progress has been made on reducing extreme poverty over the past few decades. According to the World Bank, the global extreme poverty rate has declined from nearly 50% in 1980 to about 10% in 2015. However, the COVID-19 crisis is reversing some of these gains and pushing more people into extreme poverty. The UN estimates 71 million people have been pushed back into extreme poverty in 2020 due to the economic effects of the pandemic. The Secretary-General's 2020 SDG report noted the crisis could push over 100 million people into extreme poverty, the first increase in decades.

Despite progress, extreme poverty remains a harsh reality for over 700 million people around the world who struggle to fulfill basic human needs like food, sanitation, and shelter. Poverty rates also remain disproportionately high in rural areas and among disadvantaged groups like women, indigenous populations, migrants and refugees. Tackling extreme poverty will require coordinated global action to promote equitable economic growth, increase financial inclusion, improve access to social services, build resilience against climate change and economic shocks, and empower marginalized groups.

The World Bank aims to end extreme poverty by 2030 through promoting shared prosperity and boosting the incomes of the poorest 40% of people in developing countries. The UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provides a blueprint for coordinated action between governments, the private sector, and civil society to tackle poverty. Key strategies include increasing investments in education and healthcare, promoting sustainable agricultural and economic development, increasing access to financial services and technology, empowering women and marginalized groups, and building resilient infrastructure to mitigate climate change impacts.  

In conclusion, while extreme poverty has declined globally, it remains a harsh reality for hundreds of millions of people worldwide, and the COVID-19 crisis risks reversing decades of progress. Meeting SDG 1 will require urgent collective action to promote equitable growth, build resilience, and empower the most vulnerable. With strong political will and partnerships across sectors, ending extreme poverty is possible, but the world is running out of time. Achieving this goal is critical to ensuring a sustainable future for our planet.


 Here is a draft college-level essay on Sustainable Development Goal 1:

College-level essay  

Sustainable Development Goal 1 aims to "end poverty in all its forms everywhere" by 2030. This is an ambitious goal that seeks to eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, reduce at least by half the proportion of people living in extreme poverty, and implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.   

Ending poverty requires tackling its systemic causes and implementing integrated strategies at all levels. According to the UN, poverty is more than the lack of income and resources to ensure a sustainable livelihood. Its manifestations include hunger and malnutrition, limited access to education and other basic services, social discrimination and exclusion, as well as the lack of participation in decision-making. To truly end poverty, coordinated action needs to be taken on multiple fronts including increasing access to education, healthcare, social protection, affordable energy, sustainable livelihoods, and more inclusive societies.

Major progress has been made in reducing extreme poverty. The proportion of the global population living in extreme poverty declined from 36% in 1990 to 10% in 2015 according to the World Bank. However, the pace of poverty reduction is decelerating and the poorest are being left behind. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for more than half of the extreme poverty today. Conflicts and fragile contexts also pose major challenges. COVID-19 is expected to push 71 million people into extreme poverty in 2020, the first rise in global extreme poverty since 1998 according to the World Bank. Accelerated action is urgently needed to get back on track towards ending extreme poverty.

Ending poverty will require global partnerships and cooperation. Developed countries need to fulfill their official development assistance commitments and provide additional financial resources to developing countries. International trade needs to work for the poor countries. Issues like climate change that transcend borders need global cooperation. Sharing knowledge and technical expertise at the global level is also important. Overall, ending poverty will test global solidarity and shared responsibility. With political will and a shared vision, ending poverty is possible within our lifetime. But the window for action is closing fast. Urgent and bold steps need to be taken to fulfill the promise of SDG 1.


 UN SG Speech 

Your Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, 

We have gathered here today to take stock of our collective progress on Sustainable Development Goal 1 - to end poverty in all its forms everywhere. Despite tremendous efforts, poverty remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. According to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, nearly half the world’s population, 3.4 billion people, still struggle to meet their basic needs. In the time it takes me to deliver these remarks, nearly 50 children will have died from extreme poverty and its consequences. 

My friends, this is simply unacceptable. We must renew our pledge to leave no one behind and protect the dignity of every human life. Ending poverty is not a matter of charity, but of justice and human rights. With political will and partnerships, ending extreme poverty is possible within our lifetimes. But we must act now.

Some regions of the world have made remarkable progress. In East Asia and the Pacific, extreme poverty has declined to less than 5% of the population. However, in sub-Saharan Africa, nearly 41% of people still live in extreme poverty. The UN Development Programme and UN Conference on Trade and Development have warned that the COVID-19 crisis threatens to push over 70 million people into extreme poverty, the first rise in decades. Women and marginalized groups are impacted most severely.  

To get back on track to meet SDG 1, I call upon all Member States to increase investments in social protections, health and education systems, and job creation. The private sector, civil society organizations and the UN development system must work together through multi-stakeholder partnerships to scale up solutions, share knowledge, and unlock financing. Initiatives like the UN’s Mission 1 for 1 billion campaign are also mobilizing people around the world to take action against poverty.

Ending poverty will be difficult, but it is a goal that ignites our passions for justice and human dignity. With compassion, courage and solidarity, we can realize the vision of the 2030 Agenda and unlock a future of hope and prosperity for all. The United Nations stands in partnership with you to make this vision a reality.  Together, let us keep the promise of leaving no one behind.  

Thank you.


 UN USG Speech 

Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. It is my privilege to speak to you today about Sustainable Development Goal 1 - End poverty in all its forms everywhere. This is the first and arguably the most important of the 17 SDGs adopted by world leaders in 2015. Ending poverty is the greatest global challenge facing the world today and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. 

Despite significant progress, there are still millions of people living in extreme poverty worldwide. According to the latest estimates, about 736 million people lived below the extreme poverty line in 2015, lacking access to basic needs like food, shelter, and sanitation. Most of the extreme poor live in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and about half of them are children. Poverty impacts access to education, healthcare, and job opportunities, trapping many in a vicious cycle across generations.

Ending poverty will require a multi-pronged approach. We must focus on promoting inclusive economic growth by expanding access to basic services and social protections. This includes increasing investments in public services like healthcare, education, sanitation and infrastructure. We need to support social protection programs and safety nets for the poorest and most vulnerable. We must also promote financial inclusion by increasing access to formal financial services like banking, insurance and microfinance.  

Empowering women and promoting gender equality is critical to ending poverty. We must pass laws that guarantee women's rights and enable their economic participation. We need to make education and skills training more accessible to women and girls. We must also increase access to reproductive health services and support women in overcoming societal barriers.

Climate change poses a severe threat to poverty reduction efforts. Environmental degradation and natural disasters can undermine livelihoods, damage infrastructure and push more people into poverty. We must increase investments in sustainable agriculture, renewable energy and disaster risk reduction. Developed countries need to fulfill their climate finance commitments to support mitigation and adaptation in developing countries.

Ending poverty will require partnerships across governments, civil society, the private sector and international organizations. Together, we must accelerate action to achieve the ambitious targets under SDG 1. With global cooperation and political will, we can lift millions out of poverty and build a world of shared prosperity and dignity for all. Achieving this noble goal should be a priority for the 21st century. I count on your leadership and support. Thank you.


 Political Speech: 

My fellow citizens, 

We have a moral duty to end poverty in all its forms. That is why, as a global community, we came together in 2015 and agreed on the Sustainable Development Goals, a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for all people and the planet. At the heart of this agenda is SDG 1 - to end poverty in all its forms everywhere.

Despite progress, nearly half the world's population still lives on less than $5.50 a day.  This is unacceptable. Poverty robs people of opportunities and dignity. It exacerbates inequality, and perpetuates cycles of deprivation that pass from generation to generation. 

Ending poverty will require a massive coordinated effort. According to the UN, achieving SDG 1 will take increasing social protections and safety nets, promoting pro-poor economic growth, increasing access to financial services for the poor, addressing the root causes of poverty through investments in health, education, and job opportunities, especially for women and marginalized groups. The UN's annual SDG progress report highlights that social protection systems need to be expanded to meet the needs of the poorest. Things like universal healthcare, unemployment benefits, disability assistance, and child benefits have been shown time and again to lift people out of poverty.

The UN Development Program is working with countries to promote inclusive growth, expand access to basic services, and strengthen social protection systems.  The UN's economic analysis also shows we must promote policies that generate decent jobs, especially for the nearly 61 million young people currently unemployed worldwide.  Access to new technologies and skills training are essential for young people to find work.  

My government is committed to doing its part. We have increased funding for skills training programs, expanded access to childcare and primary education, and launched new programs to assist those with disabilities. But ending poverty will require action from all sectors of society - governments, businesses, philanthropists, and individuals. Together, we must invest in the poorest and most vulnerable members of our society. We must build social safety nets, promote inclusive growth, and give every person the chance to live up to their full potential. Ending poverty will not be easy, but together we can achieve this noble goal and create a world of shared prosperity. Our planet has enough for everyone's need, but not for everyone's greed. Together, we can make SDG 1 a reality.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA):

Sustainable Development Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere 

Despite progress in reducing extreme poverty over the past decades, poverty remains a global challenge. According to the latest estimates, about 736 million people still lived in extreme poverty in 2015, surviving on less than $1.90 a day. The COVID-19 crisis is projected to push an additional 88 million to 115 million people into extreme poverty in 2020, the first rise in global poverty since 1998.

Progress on SDG 1 has been uneven across regions. While extreme poverty has declined in Asia and the Pacific, as well as in Latin America and the Caribbean, the number of people living in extreme poverty has increased in sub-Saharan Africa. Poverty rates also remain high in conflict-affected and fragile states. Women, children, youth, and marginalized groups are disproportionately affected.

To achieve SDG 1, transformative policies and targeted investments are needed to tackle poverty in all dimensions. This includes increasing access to basic services, education, healthcare, and social protection. It requires policies to promote inclusive economic growth, job creation, productive capacity development, trade, agricultural productivity increases, and rural infrastructure development. Tackling inequality by empowering the poorest and most vulnerable is key.

The COVID-19 crisis has made the mission to end poverty even more challenging, but also more urgent. Massive stimulus packages, safety nets, debt relief, and a coordinated global response can help developing countries recover in a sustainable manner. Development partners must uphold official development assistance commitments and find innovative ways to bolster development finance. South-South and triangular cooperation to share solutions should be strengthened.

Achieving SDG 1 will only be possible if the international community acts in solidarity and partnership. Ending poverty requires political will, visionary leadership, multi-sectoral and integrated policies, innovative partnerships, and technologies and data to reach those furthest behind. Urgent action is needed to get back on track to end poverty in all its dimensions. Together, we must make this vision a reality.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), Economic Analysis and Policy Division (EAPD):

Progress on SDG 1: Ending Poverty Remains Elusive But Achievable  

While extreme poverty rates have declined globally, poverty in all its forms remains a persistent challenge according to the latest research and statistics. Absolute poverty, defined as living on less than $1.90 per day, declined from 35% in 1990 to 10% in 2015, lifting more than 1 billion people out of extreme poverty. However, the pace of poverty reduction is decelerating and disproportionately concentrated in a few countries. At the current rate of progress, 6% of the global population will still live in extreme poverty in 2030, missing the target of ending extreme poverty.

Relative poverty and multidimensional poverty are even more intractable. Over 800 million people live in multidimensional poverty, lacking access to health, education, and economic opportunity. Income inequality also persists and in some countries is rising, undermining social cohesion and economic opportunity. The unevenness of progress highlights the need for targeted interventions to reach the furthest behind first. 

While economic growth has contributed to poverty reduction, its effects have not been equitably shared. The bottom 40% of the population receives less than 25% of overall income in most developing countries. Productive economic activities need to generate opportunity and upward mobility for marginalized groups. Policies must ensure that the poor participate fully in growth through access to essential infrastructure, technology, education, healthcare and credit. Fiscal policy can also play a role through progressive taxation and targeted social safety nets.

Climate change poses severe risks to poverty reduction efforts with disproportionate impacts on poor and vulnerable groups. Mitigating and adapting to climate change must be integrated in poverty reduction strategies. Building resilience of agricultural systems and empowering smallholder farmers is particularly important.

In conclusion, while extreme poverty has declined globally, relative poverty and inequality remain key challenges. Reaching the furthest behind will require targeted policies to promote inclusive growth, expand opportunity and build resilience. With political will and a coordinated global effort across sectors, ending poverty in all its forms is achievable by 2030. But the current uneven pace of progress shows much work remains to fulfill the promise of leaving no one behind.  


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the UN DESA Division for Public Institutions and Digital Government (DPIDG) targeting an expert audience:

SDG 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere 

Despite global progress, poverty remains a persistent challenge and concern around the world. According to the latest estimates, nearly half the world's population, some 3.4 billion people, still live on less than $5.50 a day. Poverty continues to manifest itself in interconnected ways, including lack of income and resources to ensure a sustainable livelihood; hunger and malnutrition; lack of access to education and key services; social discrimination and exclusion; and little or no access to economic opportunity.

To achieve SDG 1 and end poverty in all its dimensions, multidimensional policy interventions and coordinated global action are urgently needed. Strong economic growth must be inclusive to create sustainable jobs and income opportunities for the poor. Social protection programs need to be expanded, including access to health care and education. Policies should especially target those left behind, including women, youth, and marginalized groups. 

Significant progress on SDG 1 will also require addressing systemic issues that perpetuate poverty, including inequality, marginalization, climate change and environmental degradation, fragility, and conflict. Many of the deepest pockets of extreme poverty are found in places affected by conflict and crisis. Ending poverty will only be achieved through peaceful and inclusive societies where no one is left behind.
 
At the global level, developed countries must deliver on their pledges for official development assistance (ODA) and other financial commitments to support poverty reduction and sustainable development in developing countries. Additional sustainable and adequate financing, in the trillions of dollars, needs to be mobilized from private and public sources to achieve the SDGs. Global markets must also be opened to the exports of developing countries to enable growth and development.

[The response continues with several more paragraphs discussing specific challenges and recommendations around topics such as hunger and malnutrition, lack of essential services, social and economic inequality, climate change impacts, conflict and crisis, and financing the SDGs. Additional examples and data points from UN reports and databases are incorporated for an expert audience.]

In summary, ending poverty will require coordinated global action across many fronts to tackle the economic, social and environmental dimensions of poverty in a holistic, multidimensional manner. Achieving the ambitious aim of eradicating extreme poverty for all people everywhere, in all its forms, is possible, but the world must act with far greater urgency and ambition to make this a reality. With collective vision and political will, we can end poverty within our lifetimes. But the time to act is now.


 Here is a draft long analytical report on SDG 1 from the perspective of the UN DESA DISD division targeting an expert audience:

Progress Toward Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 1: No Poverty  

Ending poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing the global community. According to latest estimates, about 767 million people lived below the international poverty line of $1.90 per day in 2013. While extreme poverty rates have declined substantially over the past few decades, reducing poverty in all its dimensions, including extreme poverty, remains an immense challenge.

Significant progress has been made in reducing extreme poverty over the past few decades. The proportion of the world’s population living in extreme poverty declined from 36 percent in 1990 to 10 percent in 2015. The number of people living in extreme poverty also declined during this period, from 1.9 billion to 767 million. However, the pace of extreme poverty reduction has slowed in recent years. At the current pace, the world will still have about 650 million people living in extreme poverty in 2030, missing the SDG target. 

Regionally, most progress on reducing extreme poverty was made in East Asia and the Pacific as well as in South Asia. In East Asia, the extreme poverty rate declined from about 61 percent in 1990 to only 1.9 percent in 2017. Progress in sub-Saharan Africa has been slowest, with the extreme poverty rate only declining from 57 percent to 41 percent during this period. Significant acceleration of poverty reduction efforts is needed across all regions to achieve the SDG poverty goals by 2030, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.

While progress on reducing extreme poverty is encouraging, poverty remains a multidimensional phenomenon. The UN Development Programme’s Multidimensional Poverty Index shows that about 1.3 billion people remain in multidimensional poverty, with deprivations in areas such as health, education, and living standards. There are also significant inequalities in poverty across population groups, including rural residents, women, ethnic minorities, migrants, and persons with disabilities. These groups are often disproportionately affected by poverty but are also harder to reach with policy interventions and resources. Targeted policy actions will be required to reach the furthest behind first to ensure that no one is left behind.

 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the UN DESA Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DSDG) targeting an expert audience:

Sustainable Development Goal 1: Progress and Challenges in Ending Extreme Poverty  

Introduction

 SDG 1 aims to end poverty in all its forms everywhere by 2030. This report assesses the global progress made towards SDG 1 based on the latest data and analysis from the UN system, with a particular focus on the impact of COVID-19 on extreme poverty. It highlights areas where accelerated efforts are urgently needed to get SDG 1 back on track.

The state of extreme poverty 

According to the World Bank, the global extreme poverty rate declined to 10% in 2015, down from 16% in 2010 and 36% in 1990. However, COVID-19 is projected to push an additional 88 million to 115 million into extreme poverty in 2020, setting back progress by 3 years. The crisis has hit the poorest and most vulnerable populations the hardest, jeopardizing decades of progress made in health, education, and living standards. 

Poverty remains disproportionately high in least developed countries (LDCs) and sub-Saharan Africa. Even before COVID-19, the World Bank projected that by 2030, nearly 9 out of 10 extremely poor people would live in Sub-Saharan Africa. Urgent action is needed to curb the rise in extreme poverty, especially in the hardest-hit countries and communities. Accelerating poverty reduction will require coordinated policy action across all SDGs.

Income inequality within and among countries remains pervasive. The richest 1% of the global population owns over 40% of global wealth, while the poorest 50% own less than 1%. Inequality has increased in recent decades in many countries, as the benefits of economic growth have accrued mostly to higher-income groups. Tackling inequality will be key to making progress on SDG 1.  

[The report would continue with several more paragraphs discussing issues like access to social protection, affordable energy access, sustainable economic growth policies, good governance, and partnerships to address SDG 1 before concluding with key recommendations and next steps.]


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on SDG 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the UN DESA Financing for Sustainable Development Office (FSDO) targeting an expert audience:

SDG 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere  

Progress on SDG 1 continues to be uneven across regions and countries. According to the latest estimates, about 736 million people still lived in extreme poverty in 2015, the majority in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. While extreme poverty rates have declined globally, the absolute number of people living in extreme poverty remains unacceptably high, and progress needs to accelerate, especially in countries affected by conflict and climate change.

Poverty remains predominantly rural, and accelerating progress will require a dedicated focus on improving agricultural productivity and incomes of smallholder farmers, as well as promoting economic diversification and job creation in rural areas. Access to basic services also remains a challenge, as many poor households still lack access to healthcare, education, water, sanitation and modern energy services. Closing these access gaps must remain a priority to build the human capital of the poor and boost their income-earning potential.  

Domestic resource mobilization is key to financing national poverty reduction strategies and social protection systems. Many developing countries can increase tax revenues by broadening the tax base, improving tax administration and reducing tax evasion and avoidance. Official development assistance also continues to play an important role in complementing domestic resources for the poorest and most vulnerable countries. Remittance flows to developing countries have increased in recent years and can also support poverty reduction, though more data is needed to fully capture their impact.

Blended finance and public-private partnerships show promise for mobilizing additional financing for poverty reduction. However, regulatory frameworks and policies need to be strengthened to incentivize private sector investments that target the poor and maximize development impact. South-South cooperation can also provide avenues for knowledge exchange on policies and programs that have been effective in reducing poverty.  

In conclusion, while progress has been achieved, accelerated action is urgently needed to boost incomes, strengthen social protection systems, improve access to basic services and finance national poverty reduction strategies. A mix of domestic resources, ODA, private investments and South-South cooperation will be required to end poverty in all its dimensions by 2030. With strong political will and a collaborative approach across all sectors of society, ending extreme poverty is achievable. But the next decade will be critical. Urgent action now can change the lives of millions and lead us closer to a sustainable world of prosperity and equality.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 1 (No Poverty) in the style of UNDP:

Progress on Sustainable Development Goal 1: Ending Poverty  

SDG 1 calls for the eradication of extreme poverty for all people everywhere by 2030. This ambitious goal aims to lift over 800 million people out of extreme poverty, reducing the share of people living in extreme poverty to 3% of the global population. According to the UN's Multidimensional Poverty Index, over 2.1 billion people still live in multidimensional poverty. Significant progress has been made in reducing poverty over the past few decades, but accelerated action is still needed to meet the targets of SDG 1.

Target 1.1 calls for eradicating extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day. The global poverty rate has fallen from 38% in 1990 to under 8% in 2018 according to the World Bank, lifting over 1 billion people out of extreme poverty. Despite this progress, 736 million people worldwide still live in extreme poverty according to the UN. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the highest rates of extreme poverty, currently at 35% of the population. In order to eradicate extreme poverty, increased investments in social services and economic growth in least developed countries will be critical. Cash transfer programs, microfinance initiatives, and stronger social safety nets can help lift the poorest segments of populations out of poverty.  

Target 1.2 aims to reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions. About 84% of countries have defined a national poverty line and multidimensional poverty measure. However, nationally-defined poverty rates are still high in many countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Accelerating progress on this target will require country-specific policies and programs tailored to national poverty measures and populations most at risk.  

[The response continues with several more paragraphs on the other targets under SDG 1, discussing issues around access to resources and basic services, climate change and resilience, poverty data availability and monitoring, and policy/programmatic recommendations to accelerate progress.]

In summary, while remarkable gains have been made in reducing extreme poverty, accelerated progress is urgently needed to meet the ambitious targets set out in SDG 1. Reduced inequalities, increased investments in human capital and social services, steady economic growth, and strengthened resilience will be key to ending poverty in all its dimensions. Stronger data and policy coherence can further help identify and reach those furthest behind. With concerted global efforts and political will, ending poverty is possible within our lifetime. But the time for action is now.

Progress and Challenges in Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 1: End Poverty  

Sustainable Development Goal 1 aims to eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere by 2030. According to the latest estimates from the World Bank, the global poverty rate has declined to under 10% for the first time in history. Despite this progress, 736 million people still live in extreme poverty, especially in rural areas and conflict-affected regions. Furthermore, income inequality within and among many countries has widened in recent decades.

To achieve SDG 1, coordinated action is needed to tackle the multidimensional nature of poverty. Access to basic services must be improved, including education, healthcare, water and sanitation. Social protection programs should be expanded to vulnerable populations. Policy reforms should promote inclusive growth, full employment and support small businesses and microfinance. National anti-poverty strategies should incorporate data on deprived and marginalized groups.  

Developing countries face significant challenges in financing SDG 1. Domestic resource mobilization should be strengthened, including improving tax collection systems and broadening the tax base. Official development assistance needs to be doubled, with a greater focus on least developed countries and fragile states. Blended finance instruments that combine public and private funding can help scale up investments in poverty reduction. South-South cooperation also has an important role to play.  

Progress on SDG 1 has been uneven across regions. Poverty rates remain high in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. In Latin America and the Caribbean, poverty has declined but income inequality is rising. The Arab region continues to grapple with multidimensional poverty due to conflicts and economic crises. In Europe and North America, relative poverty and homelessness are growing concerns.   

Achieving SDG 1 will require coordinated responses at national, regional and global levels. Policies and investments should target the poorest and most vulnerable groups. Stronger partnerships are needed across governments, civil society, private sector and international organizations. Accelerated action must be taken to end poverty in all its dimensions, leaving no one behind. With just 10 years left to achieve the SDGs, now is the time to scale up efforts to eradicate extreme poverty and build a sustainable future for all.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) targeting an expert audience:

Progress on SDG 1: Ending Poverty in Africa  

Poverty remains a persistent challenge in Africa, home to the majority of the world’s extreme poor. Despite progress, about 413 million Africans still live in extreme poverty, more than all other regions combined. Overcoming poverty is central to achieving inclusive and sustainable development in Africa.   

According to the latest estimates, the proportion of African people living in extreme poverty declined from 54% in 1990 to 41% in 2015. However, due to population growth, the total number of people in extreme poverty increased from 278 million to 413 million over the same period. Poverty rates vary significantly across African regions and countries. Poverty is concentrated in rural areas, where social services and income opportunities are limited. Women, children, youth, and other marginalized groups are most affected.  

To achieve SDG 1 and end poverty in Africa, countries must accelerate inclusive economic growth and job creation, especially for youth and women. Investing in rural development, agriculture and resilience is key. Countries should expand social protection programmes, increase access to basic services, and build sustainable infrastructure. Policies and programmes targeting women, such as improving access to financial services, are important to unlocking economic potential. African governments must strengthen domestic resource mobilization to fund national anti-poverty agendas. 
 
There has been progress in establishing social protection systems in Africa, but coverage remains limited. Only about 18% of the population receive any form of social protection benefit. Expanding coverage of income support, healthcare, and other programmes can help lift more people out of poverty. 

In conclusion, while extreme poverty rates have declined in Africa, the total number of people living in extreme poverty remains unacceptably high. Achieving SDG 1 will require accelerated action at scale. African governments and partners must urgently work to promote inclusive growth and job creation, invest in social services and rural development, expand social protection, empower women and marginalized groups, and strengthen financial inclusion. Ending poverty will be integral to Africa achieving the wider 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063. Overall progress on SDG 1 in Africa remains insufficient, and bold action is needed over the coming decade to end poverty in all its forms.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Europe targeting an expert audience:

Progress on Sustainable Development Goal 1: Ending Poverty   

Goal 1 of the Sustainable Development Goals aims to end poverty in all its forms by 2030. This goal encompasses targets around eradicating extreme poverty, implementing social protection systems and measures for all, ensuring equal rights to economic resources and access to basic services, building resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations, and ensuring significant resource mobilization from a variety of sources to implement policies and programmes aimed at ending poverty.  

According to the latest estimates from the World Bank, the global extreme poverty rate has declined to about 10 percent in 2015, down from 36 percent in 1990. If this trend continues, the World Bank projects that the extreme poverty rate could fall to 6 percent or lower by 2030. However, due to population growth in the developing world, the number of people living in extreme poverty globally remains unacceptably high at over 700 million. Progress on reducing poverty has also been uneven across regions, with South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa remaining home to the largest numbers of people living in extreme poverty.  

In the UNECE region, which includes many developed countries, extreme poverty is relatively rare. However, income inequality has been rising in many countries. Some population groups, such as single parents, the unemployed, migrants and marginalized communities still face a higher risk of poverty. Social protection systems need to be strengthened and adapted to provide adequate support for these groups. Many middle-income countries in Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia have not developed comprehensive social protection systems, leaving parts of their populations vulnerable.  

To accelerate progress on SDG 1, the following actions are urgently needed:  
1) Increase investments in eradicating extreme poverty, especially in least developed countries and those with high poverty rates. Protect and expand social protection programs and essential services for the poor.  
2) Promote inclusive economic growth and decent job creation. Support small businesses and make financial services accessible to the poor.   
3) Increase cooperation on tax matters and strengthen domestic resource mobilization. Crack down on corruption and illicit financial flows which deprive developing countries of resources to invest in poverty eradication.  
4) Improve data collection and monitoring of SDG 1 targets, especially on multidimensional poverty. Disaggregate data by factors like gender, age and disability status to enhance policies targeting the poorest and most vulnerable.  

In conclusion, while global poverty has declined, extreme poverty remains too high. Concerted policy actions and cooperation are urgently needed to lift the billions still living in extreme poverty and make the SDG goal of ending poverty in all its forms by 2030 a reality. With political will and determination, ending poverty is achievable in our lifetimes. But the time for action is now.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) for an expert audience:

Reducing poverty in all its forms remains critical to achieving sustainable development in Latin America and the Caribbean. While the region has made significant progress in reducing extreme poverty over the past few decades, poverty rates remain stubbornly high, and in recent years, advances have stalled. According to ECLAC estimates, 30.2% of the population, or 185 million people, lived in poverty in 2019. Of those, 62 million lived in extreme poverty. 

ECLAC analysis shows that poverty remains deeply entrenched and intergenerationally transmitted in LAC. The poor have limited access to basic services and economic opportunities, undermining their ability to build human capital and lift themselves out of poverty. High inequality also makes poverty reduction much harder to achieve. Economic growth alone has not been enough—social policies and income redistribution are needed.

Critical challenges remain to end poverty in all its forms in LAC. Economic and political changes, especially as a result of COVID-19, threaten to reverse progress and exacerbate poverty and inequality. ECLAC is focused on these priorities to get back on track to meet this Sustainable Development Goal:

1. Accelerate economic growth through investment in sustainable sectors like renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and ecotourism. Economic diversification can make growth more inclusive and resilient.  

2.Increase public spending on basic universal social protection programs, especially for vulnerable groups. Expanding coverage of programs like conditional cash transfers, unemployment insurance, and universal basic incomes can help reduce poverty. 

3.Improve tax systems to increase government revenue and enable greater redistribution. Increasing progressive income taxes, property taxes, and taxes on multinational corporations can fund expanded social programs without debt.

4.Increase access to education, healthcare, and other services for the poor. Investing in human development and the SDGs simultaneously expands opportunity and reduces poverty.  

5.Implement policies to reduce inequality in income and opportunity. Strong labor rights, increased minimum wages, and eliminating discriminatory laws can help distribute the benefits of growth more evenly. 

By taking an integrated, targeted approach across these areas, ECLAC believes LAC countries can reignite progress towards ending poverty and set the region on course to achieve this critical Sustainable Development Goal by 2030. But political will and determination will be essential to make progress at the scale needed. Overall coordination of social, economic and environmental policies will be key.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP):

Progress on SDG 1 in Asia and the Pacific: A Long Road Ahead  

Despite robust economic growth in Asia and the Pacific in recent decades, the region remains home to more than half of the world's poor. Poverty rates vary widely across subregions and countries, but on average, about 10% of the region's population still lives in extreme poverty. While progress has been made, achieving SDG 1 will require strengthened national policies, regional cooperation, and increased investments to lift the remaining millions of people out of poverty.

National policies and action: Most countries in the region have integrated SDGs into their national development plans and set targets to reduce poverty. Some of the key policies include increasing social protection coverage, raising minimum wages, expanding access to public services, and boosting agricultural production and rural development. However, policy gaps remain in many countries, for example, on tax reforms, universal healthcare, and sustainable energy access for the poor. Strengthening policy coherence, accountability, and partnerships with civil society will be key to accelerating progress.  

Regional cooperation: Poverty reduction would benefit from increased regional economic integration and cooperation on trade, technology, and knowledge transfers. There are opportunities to strengthen financial and technical support for LDCs and LLDCs. Regional bodies like ESCAP have a role to play to facilitate cross-country learning on anti-poverty policies, build statistical capacity, and advocate for the inclusion of marginalized groups. More research is also needed on the impacts of forces like climate change, demographic shifts, and inequality on poverty in the region.

Investments and financing: Most countries will require higher levels of investment in areas like social protection, healthcare, education, and job creation to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030. This calls for increased public spending, more private sector partnerships, and development assistance. Blended finance and impact investments should be leveraged to fund programs targeting the poor. Access to affordable credit for the poor and vulnerable groups needs to expand. South-South cooperation on development financing must also strengthen.  

In conclusion, while countries have shown strong commitment to SDG 1, progress remains uneven and vulnerabilities persist. Concerted policy actions, regional partnerships, and increased short- and long-term investments in people and planet will be essential to ensure the poor and marginalized in Asia and the Pacific are not left behind. Collective will and vision at all levels will determine whether the region can rise to the challenge of eradicating extreme poverty within the next decade.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) targeting an expert audience:

Progress on Sustainable Development Goal 1 in the ESCWA Region: A Long Way to Go  

Despite some gains, the ESCWA region continues to face significant challenges in eradicating poverty in all its forms. According to the latest estimates, nearly 44 million people in the region live in extreme poverty, subsisting on less than $1.90 per day. Poverty rates remain highest in the least developed countries of the region, including Sudan, Yemen, and Djibouti, where over 40% of the population lives in extreme poverty. 

Income inequality also continues to rise in many ESCWA countries, with the richest 10% of the population earning on average over 6 times more than the poorest 40% of the population. While economic growth across the region has been steady over the past decade, the benefits of this growth have not translated into improved standards of living for the most vulnerable populations. Government social spending as a percentage of GDP remains well below global averages, limiting governments’ abilities to invest in social safety nets, healthcare, education, and other services that could lift more citizens out of poverty.

Women and marginalized groups remain disproportionately affected by poverty. For example, while the overall poverty rate in ESCWA countries is around 15%, poverty rates among women are nearly 20% higher. Rural populations also face higher poverty at over 25% compared to just under 10% in urban areas. With nearly half the population under the age of 25, high youth unemployment exacerbates the risk of intergenerational poverty transmission. Over 30% of youth in the region are unemployed, and many face poor job prospects.   

To accelerate progress on SDG 1, ESCWA member states should:

1. Increase government social spending, especially on social protection programs and essential services like healthcare, education, and affordable housing. Cash transfer programs have been particularly effective at reducing extreme poverty. 

2. Strengthen progressive tax policies to generate more revenue and reduce income inequality. Reforming energy subsidies and improving tax collection can generate funds to invest in poverty reduction efforts.   

3. Improve data collection, especially on multidimensional poverty, unemployment, and socioeconomic inequalities. Better data will enable governments to target resources at the most vulnerable groups and geographic locations.

4. Prioritize poverty reduction in national development plans and budgets. Countries should set concrete targets and timelines for poverty reduction, especially extreme poverty, anchored in the SDG framework.

5. Empower women and marginalized groups through access to financial services, job opportunities, healthcare, education, and skill development programs. Tackling multidimensional poverty requires a targeted, rights-based approach to inclusive development.  

ESCWA remains committed to supporting member states in sharing best practices, mobilizing partnerships, and advising on evidence-based policies to accelerate SDG 1 achievement over the next decade. Eradicating poverty is challenging but achievable if the political will exists to make difficult decisions, reach those furthest behind, and promote inclusive and equitable growth. Together, we must spare no effort to free the region from poverty in all its dimensions.


 Here is a draft analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty) from the perspective of UN DESA targeting an expert audience with a focus on middle-income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere  

Despite significant progress in reducing extreme poverty over the past few decades, 10% of the world’s population still lives in extreme poverty, struggling to fulfill even the most basic necessities of life. For middle-income countries, the scale of extreme poverty remains a key challenge, even as economic growth has lifted millions into the middle class. According to the World Bank, middle-income countries are home to 73% of the world’s poor. Reducing poverty and inequality in these rapidly growing economies must be a high priority to achieve SDG 1.

Extreme poverty remains disproportionately high in rural areas of middle-income countries, and among marginalized groups. Access to basic services and social protections remains uneven. Investing in rural infrastructure, agricultural development, education, and healthcare will be critical to boost opportunity and resilience for the poor. Expanding cash transfer programs, unemployment benefits, and other social safety nets can help address temporary poverty and protect the poor during economic downturns.  

Economic growth alone will not be enough. Growth needs to be inclusive and sustainable, generating more and better jobs that provide fair wages and safe working conditions, especially for women and youth. Discrimination and lack of access to resources and financial services create systematic disadvantages for some groups. Tackling multidimensional poverty will require coordinated policy action across sectors to promote inclusion, equality and human development.

While poverty has declined in many middle-income countries, countries will need to pursue more ambitious policy actions to end poverty sustainably. Public and private sector actors will need to work together to align investments and innovations with the SDGs. International cooperation and knowledge sharing can support best practices for reaching those furthest behind. Ending poverty will only be achieved through a shared commitment to leave no one behind. With concerted action and political will, ending extreme poverty in middle-income countries by 2030 is challenging but within our reach.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, written for an expert audience and focused on middle-income countries:

Progress on SDG 1: No Poverty in Middle-Income Countries 

While extreme poverty has declined rapidly in many parts of the world, its eradication remains elusive, especially in middle-income countries. According to the latest estimates, 736 million people lived in extreme poverty in 2015, with nearly 80% residing in middle-income countries. Poverty remains disproportionately high in rural areas and among disadvantaged groups including women, children, and indigenous populations. 

In East and South Asia, despite years of strong economic growth, nearly 300 million people remain in extreme poverty. While poverty rates have declined substantially in China and elsewhere, economic growth has not benefitted the poorest and most marginalized groups. Inequality remains high and social protection systems are limited, leaving many vulnerable to fall back into poverty due to economic shocks, health issues, or natural disasters.

In Latin America and the Caribbean, extreme poverty is concentrated in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, though nearly 40 million in the region as a whole live on less than $1.90/day. Extreme poverty is highest among indigenous groups, Afro-descendants, and rural populations. Poverty reduction has stalled in recent years due to political and economic turmoil, highlighting the need for targeted social programs and investments in addition to GDP growth.

The COVID-19 crisis is projected to push millions back into extreme poverty, especially in densely populated middle-income countries with limited health and social protection systems. Countries must take urgent action to curb the spread of the virus while implementing broad-based fiscal stimulus, social assistance for the poor and vulnerable, and protecting jobs. Building more equitable, sustainable, and resilient societies that leave no one behind is key to ending poverty in all its dimensions.

To accelerate progress on SDG 1, middle-income countries should increase investments in social protection and rural development, expand economic opportunities for disadvantaged groups, strengthen policy frameworks to reduce inequality, and improve data collection and monitoring to better target resources at those left furthest behind. Ending poverty will require cooperation across all levels of government, civil society, private sector and the international community. With only ten years left to achieve the 2030 Agenda, now is the time for bold action to ensure no one is living in extreme poverty.


 Here is a draft long-form analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), specifically its Development Policy and Analysis Division (DPIDG), targeted at an expert audience and focused on middle-income countries:

Progress on Sustainable Development Goal 1: No Poverty in Middle-Income Countries 

Poverty eradication remains an immense challenge and moral imperative, even as extreme poverty rates have declined globally. According to the World Bank, nearly half the world’s poor now live in middle-income countries, defined as countries with a GNI per capita of between $1,026 and $12,475. Ending poverty will require targeted policies and investments to boost economic growth and jobs, expand social safety nets, and support the poorest and most vulnerable in these middle-income countries.  

Despite overall economic growth, income inequality within many middle-income countries has risen substantially. The poorest quintile has seen little increase in income and consumption. Women, ethnic minorities, migrants, and other marginalized groups remain disproportionately impoverished. Lack of access to healthcare, education, infrastructure, and financial services further entrenches poverty across generations. Climate change exacerbates vulnerability, with environmental degradation disproportionately harming the poor.   

Most middle-income countries have social safety net programs, but coverage and benefits remain limited. As countries transition to higher income levels, social spending and coverage often plateau or even decline over time. Cash transfer programs have been shown effective at reducing poverty and inequality, but reach only a fraction of those in need. Healthcare and education require greater investment to foster human capital and long-term development.   

Job creation through private sector growth and industrialization remains the primary pathway out of poverty for most middle-income countries. However, the shift to more highly skilled labour and automation continues to displace many low-skilled jobs, while job growth remains insufficient to absorb new labour market entrants. Both the scale and quality of employment must increase to meaningfully reduce poverty. Access to finance and training can help the poor take advantage of new economic opportunities. Partnerships with the private sector to promote sustainable business practices and decent work are also key.

In conclusion, middle-income countries have made progress on SDG 1 but still have a long way to go to eradicate poverty in all its dimensions. Success will require policies and programs tailored to country contexts, with targeted support for the poorest groups and communities. By investing in inclusive growth, social protection, healthcare, education, and decent work, middle-income countries can make progress in ending poverty and improving well-being for all. But greater ambition and partnerships across all sectors of society will be needed to meet the promise of SDG 1.


 Here is a draft analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty) from the perspective of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Division for Inclusive Social Development, targeting an expert audience and focused on middle-income countries:

Progress on SDG 1: Ending Poverty in Middle-Income Countries  

While extreme poverty has declined globally, its persistence remains a key challenge, especially in middle-income countries. According to the World Bank, nearly half the world’s poor live in middle-income countries, where economic growth has not always translated into poverty reduction. Ending poverty will require targeted, multi-pronged approaches in these countries.  

In Latin America and the Caribbean, the region with the greatest share of middle-income countries, the extreme poverty rate fell from 12% to 5% between 1999 to 2016, but not fast enough to meet SDG 1. At the current pace, 6% of the population will still live in extreme poverty in 2030. Addressing inequality and boosting job creation are critical. UNDP and UNCTAD studies show that rising inequality hampers poverty reduction and economic mobility in the region. Meanwhile, the informal sector employs over 60% of the workforce, indicating a need for policies that support decent job creation and transitioning to the formal economy.

In Asia and the Pacific, the extreme poverty rate is on track to meet the 3% target, but national rates vary widely, from less than 1% to over 30% in some middle-income countries. Moreover, poverty remains overwhelmingly rural, so agricultural development and infrastructure investments are sorely needed. The UNESCAP recommends increased spending on sustainable agriculture, renewable energy access, and telecommunications infrastructure in remote areas.   

In the Middle East, instability and conflict have reversed poverty gains, while in North Africa poverty remains isolated but entrenched in marginalized communities. The UN Economic and Social Commission for West Asia (ESCWA) proposes increased access to social protections, healthcare, education and economic opportunities for refugees, migrants, youth, women and remote communities. Cash transfer programs, microfinance and vocational training have proven effective and should be scaled up.  

To accelerate progress, UN entities including UN DESA’s DISD recommend the following priorities for middle-income countries: developing social protection systems, promoting inclusive economic policies, boosting agricultural and rural development, expanding access to basic services, adopting risk mitigation strategies, and strengthening data collection and analysis to inform evidence-based anti-poverty policies. With political will and targeted investments, ending poverty in all its forms is possible by 2030. But middle-income countries cannot be left behind. Addressing the specific challenges faced by this diverse group of countries is critical to fulfilling the vision of the 2030 Agenda.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DSDG), targeting an expert audience and with a focus on middle-income countries:

Progress on SDG 1: No Poverty in Middle-Income Countries  

While extreme poverty rates have declined globally, poverty remains an immense challenge, especially in middle-income countries. According to the World Bank, middle-income countries are home to 5 of the world’s 7 billion people but make up nearly three-quarters of those living in extreme poverty. Reducing poverty will require targeted action aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDG 1: No Poverty.

In 2019, the proportion of the population living below the international poverty line (US$1.90 per day) was more than 4 times higher in middle-income countries compared to high-income countries, despite significant economic growth in the former group. Poverty reduction has also slowed in middle-income countries, declining at only half the rate of the previous 25 years. At the current pace, the world will fall short of the SDG 1 target of ending extreme poverty by 2030.  

The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to further undermine progress. The economic consequences of the crisis are disproportionately impacting middle-income economies, with IMF projections indicating average income declines of over 5 percent in 2020. Job losses, food insecurity and lack of access to healthcare are plunging millions back into poverty. Targeted policy actions are urgently needed to curb these reversals and minimize long-term scarring.

A range of actions can reignite progress on SDG 1 in middle-income countries:

•Increase social protection programs including cash transfers, unemployment benefits and food assistance to protect the vulnerable. Countries should aim for a basic level of social protection coverage for all.

•Invest in healthcare, education and job retraining. Access to these essential services helps lift people out of poverty and promotes inclusive growth. 

•Support informal workers and SMEs. This group makes up a large share of employment in middle-income economies but often lacks access to finance, social protections and government support programs.

•Address inequality through progressive fiscal policies, including more equitable tax systems and closing loopholes. Inequality remains high in most middle-income countries and undermines poverty reduction.

•Improve governance and institutions. Corruption, lack of transparency and accountability are major obstacles to poverty alleviation. Governance reforms can help ensure growth is inclusive and the benefits of prosperity are shared widely.

•Increase official development assistance and South-South cooperation. Additional financial and technical support for the poorest middle-income countries is vital to meeting the SDGs. 

In summary, accelerated progress on SDG 1 in middle-income countries will require urgent action to counteract the impacts of COVID-19, promote inclusive growth and social protection, tackle inequality and strengthen governance and institutions. With renewed commitment, ending extreme poverty in all its forms remains within reach. But the window for action is closing—the next decade is crucial.


 Here is a draft long-form analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty) from the perspective of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, targeting an expert audience and with a focus on middle-income countries:

Progress on SDG 1: Ending Poverty in Middle-Income Countries  

While extreme poverty has declined globally, its persistence in middle-income countries requires targeted action. According to the UN Secretary-General's latest SDG progress report, an estimated 736 million people worldwide still live in extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $1.90 per day. The vast majority of the extreme poor, around 413 million people, now live in middle-income countries. Despite overall economic growth, poverty rates in these countries have declined at a slower pace. Urgent action is needed to boost the speed and scale of poverty reduction.  

Challenges in middle-income countries center around inequality, economic vulnerability, and lack of access to social services. While GDP has risen in many middle-income countries, the benefits of growth have not been evenly distributed. The bottom 40% of populations have often seen little improvement in living standards. High levels of income and wealth inequality directly impede poverty reduction. Economic vulnerability also remains high, with many lacking access to stable livelihoods and social safety nets. Public spending on essential services like education, healthcare, and social protection remains low in many middle-income countries relative to their level of development. 

To accelerate progress on SDG 1, tailored policy interventions for middle-income countries are urgently needed:

•Invest in inclusive growth and job creation. Promote labor-intensive sectors, strengthen education and skills development, expand access to finance for small businesses and entrepreneurs. This can help the poor benefit from overall economic growth.  

•Increase spending on essential services. Raise public expenditures on basic education, healthcare, and social protection. Expand coverage and increase benefits of social safety net programs like cash transfers that directly help the poor.

•Tackle inequality through progressive fiscal reforms. Implement policies like raising tax rates on high-income individuals and large corporations. Use additional tax revenues to fund social programs that benefit the poor. Consider instituting or raising minimum wages and strengthening labor protections.

•Build resilience to economic shocks. Expand and strengthen social protection programs so people can maintain access to necessities even during times of crisis. Diversify economies so they are less dependent on a single commodity or sector. Improve savings and risk management mechanisms for the poorest.

•Improve data availability and monitoring. Many middle-income countries lack high-quality data on poverty, inequality, and access to services. Improved data collection and sharing can help identify geographical regions and population groups that remain unreached, enabling better-targeted policies and programs. Close monitoring of existing policies and programs is also needed to determine their impact and cost-effectiveness.  

In summary, while ending extreme poverty will require global action, sustained progress in middle-income countries is crucial. By adopting tailored strategies focused on inclusion, resilience, and monitoring, these countries can secure a future free of the worst deprivations for all their citizens. But political will and follow-through are urgently needed to implement policies and programs that will improve the lives of the marginalized and help realize SDG 1.


 Here is a draft analytical report in the style of UNDP on the current progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty) with a focus on middle-income countries:

Progress on SDG 1: Ending Poverty in Middle-Income Countries 

While extreme poverty rates have declined globally, middle-income countries face significant challenges in eradicating poverty. According to the World Bank, middle-income countries are home to 73% of the world's poor, even as they have experienced strong economic growth. Reducing poverty in these dynamic and diverse economies requires multifaceted, targeted policies that promote inclusive growth and build human capital.

Progress on SDG 1 targets in middle-income countries has been uneven. On target 1.1, reducing at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty, according to the latest estimates, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty declined to 9.2% in 2017, however the pace of poverty reduction has slowed. While East Asia and the Pacific have made tremendous gains, Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America have struggled with poverty reduction. Within countries, rural populations, indigenous communities and other marginalized groups remain far more likely to live in poverty. 

On target 1.2, implementing social protection systems and programs for all, middle-income countries have expanded social safety net programs but coverage and adequacy remain issues. Countries like China, South Africa, Brazil, Thailand and others have introduced or expanded cash transfer programs, public works programs and social insurance for workers in the informal sector. However, the majority of the poor still do not have access to social protection. Expanding coverage, benefits and participation in social protection systems is critical for building resilience against economic shocks. 

Achieving target 1.4, ensuring equal rights to economic resources and access to basic services, requires policies that specifically target disadvantaged groups. Legal reforms are needed in some countries to strengthen women’s rights to land and property. Indigenous communities frequently lack rights to their ancestral lands and natural resources. In many countries, disadvantaged ethnic minorities face discrimination in access to healthcare, education and employment opportunities. Targeted investments in basic infrastructure and public services for marginalized communities can help fulfill this target.

[Continues with analysis for other SDG 1 targets...]

In summary, while many middle-income countries have made progress on SDG 1, sustained political commitment and targeted policies are still needed to eradicate poverty in all its forms, especially for disadvantaged populations. By building inclusive growth, expanding social protection, and promoting equal access to resources and services, middle-income countries can achieve the vision of ending poverty. But greater cooperation between governments, international organizations, civil society and the private sector is vital to accomplish this ambitious agenda.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 1 (No Poverty) in the style of UNCTAD targeting an expert audience and with a focus on middle income countries:

Progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 1 in middle income countries: An assessment 

While extreme poverty has declined globally, its persistence in middle income countries requires urgent action. According to the World Bank, middle income countries were home to about half the world’s poor in 2015 based on the $1.90 per day poverty line. Significant challenges remain in reducing poverty in these countries, especially multidimensional poverty encompassing lack of access to health, education, and other basic services.  

Poverty in middle income countries is often exacerbated by inequality, economic instability, and lack of decent work opportunities. High income inequality means the benefits of economic growth are not shared evenly across the population. Economic instability, whether due to financial crises, commodity price fluctuations or natural disasters, can quickly plunge vulnerable populations into poverty. And lack of access to stable, well-paying jobs with decent working conditions makes it difficult for the poor to improve their situation.

While economic growth is necessary for poverty reduction, it is not sufficient. Targeted policies and programs are needed to reach the poorest and most marginalized. Social protection programs including cash transfer programs, school feeding programs and targeted subsidies have been shown to reduce poverty and inequality in middle income countries. However, these programs often do not reach all those in need due to lack of funding and administrative capacity. Extending social protection to workers in the informal economy remains a key challenge.   

Access to basic services is another area requiring improvement. While primary education enrollment rates have increased, completion rates remain low in many middle income countries, especially for girls. Lack of access to healthcare, safe water and sanitation also disproportionately affect the poor. Governments must increase public spending on health, education and infrastructure to achieve universal access to these basic services. Partnerships with civil society and private sector can help fill gaps where government capacity is lacking.

In conclusion, reducing poverty in middle income countries will require comprehensive social and economic policies targeting inequality, lack of decent work, and gaps in access to basic services. With strong political will and partnerships across government, civil society and private sector, ending extreme poverty in middle income countries by 2030 is achievable. But progress will require prioritizing the needs of the poorest and marginalized populations who continue to be left behind. Collective action is key to ensuring no one is left behind on the journey towards zero poverty.


 Here is a draft analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Africa targeting an expert audience and focusing on middle-income countries:

Progress on SDG 1: No Poverty in Middle-Income Countries  

While extreme poverty has declined globally, its persistence remains a challenge especially in middle-income countries. According to recent estimates, middle-income countries are home to 73% of the global poor living on less than $1.90 per day. Poverty in middle-income countries is often exacerbated by inequality, economic instability, climate change impacts, and lack of social protections.

Inequality remains a key driver of poverty in middle-income countries. Many middle-income countries have experienced strong economic growth in recent decades, but the benefits have not reached the poorest populations. The incomes of the wealthiest groups are many times higher than the poorest. Closing inequality gaps in income and opportunity can significantly impact poverty reduction. Policies like progressive taxation, universal health coverage, and investments in education and skills training for disadvantaged groups can help address inequality.  

Economic instability and downturns threaten poverty reduction gains. Many middle-income countries remain dependent on primary commodity exports and are thus exposed to price volatility and external shocks. Diversifying economies and increasing value addition in commodity sectors can reduce economic instability. Building strong social protection systems including unemployment benefits, healthcare, and cash transfer programs can also help shield the poor during economic hardship.  

Climate change poses risks to poverty reduction efforts. Many middle-income countries face threats like droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events which can push vulnerable people into poverty. Investing in climate change mitigation and adaptation, with a focus on smallholder farmers and poor communities, is critical. Transitioning to more sustainable agricultural practices, crop diversification, access to drought/flood resistant seeds can improve resilience. Developing renewable energy infrastructure while ensuring affordable access for the poor can support a green transition.

In conclusion, while poverty has declined in many middle-income countries, strengthened efforts around inequality, economic stability and climate change can accelerate progress towards ending poverty in all its forms. With strong political will and investments in human development, middle-income countries can achieve SDG 1. But greater international support and cooperation is also needed, especially for climate finance and sustainable development. Achieving SDG 1 will require a shared vision and commitment to leaving no one behind.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Europe, targeted at an expert audience and focused on middle-income countries:

Progress on SDG 1: Eliminating poverty in middle-income countries 

While extreme poverty has declined globally, its persistence in middle-income countries requires targeted action. According to recent estimates, middle-income countries are home to 62% of the world’s poor. Poverty in these countries is often exacerbated by economic slowdowns, natural disasters, climate change, conflict, and lack of access to resources and public services for vulnerable groups. Tackling poverty in middle-income countries demands multi-pronged strategies that foster inclusive growth, build resilience, and target disadvantaged populations.  

Economic growth in middle-income countries has been robust over the past decade, averaging 5% per year. However, the benefits of this growth have not reached the poorest segments of the population. Growth has been concentrated in capital-intensive sectors with limited job creation, while public spending on health, education, and social protection has stagnated. To ensure that growth translates into poverty reduction, countries should diversify their economies, support labor-intensive industries, increase spending on public services, and make tax systems more progressive. Investing in human capital through education, healthcare and skills training can also make growth more inclusive and help the poor access better economic opportunities.

While economic growth is necessary to reduce poverty, it is not sufficient. Countries must also build resilience to shocks that push vulnerable households into poverty. Strengthening social protection systems is critical, including expanding coverage of cash transfer programs, unemployment benefits, and disaster risk insurance. Enhancing access to financial services can also help the poor better cope with economic losses. Integrating disaster risk reduction into development planning and improving capacities to respond to natural disasters and climate change impacts will further strengthen resilience.   

Certain populations face higher risks of poverty due to discrimination, lack of access to resources and public services. Countries should target these groups through dedicated policies and programs. For ethnic minorities, indigenous groups and rural populations, this could include promoting inclusive education, healthcare, infrastructure and economic opportunities. For persons with disabilities, countries need to improve access to assistive technologies, healthcare, education and employment. Migrants and refugees also require targeted support through language and skills training, and facilitating access to jobs and government services. Achieving SDG 1 will require addressing the structural barriers that perpetuate poverty across generations.

In conclusion, while middle-income countries have made progress in reducing extreme poverty, sustained action is needed to support inclusive growth, build resilience, and target disadvantaged groups. By implementing multi-sectoral strategies that promote access to resources and economic opportunity for the poorest members of society, countries can achieve the vision of eradicating poverty in all its forms. But success will depend on political will and societies that uphold the fundamental principles of equal opportunity and justice for all.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) focused on middle-income countries:

Progress on SDG 1: Ending poverty in middle-income countries  

While extreme poverty has declined globally, its persistence in middle-income countries remains a challenge. According to the Secretary-General’s latest SDG progress report, over 70% of the world’s poor now live in middle-income countries. Despite overall economic growth, inequality and lack of opportunity have prevented the benefits from reaching the poorest segments of the population.  

In the Latin American and Caribbean region, which ECLAC serves, there are still over 184 million people living in poverty and 62 million in extreme poverty, even though two-thirds of countries in the region are considered middle- or high-income. Poverty remains especially high in rural areas, among indigenous groups, women, youth, and minorities. While social programs have helped reduce poverty, coverage and benefits remain uneven across countries and populations.  

A multidimensional approach is needed to truly end poverty that goes beyond income alone. Issues like lack of education, healthcare, housing, access to basic services, and economic opportunity all contribute to the cycle of poverty. But while nearly all countries have poverty reduction strategies in place, few effectively tackle poverty’s structural causes or consider all its dimensions. Greater investments in people are needed, particularly in health, education, and skills training.  

At the current rate of progress, the region will not end extreme poverty by 2030. Accelerated action is urgently needed. ECLAC calls on member states to increase investments in social programs, target vulnerable groups, strengthen tax systems, and improve policy coherence. Regional cooperation on data sharing, public policy innovations and South-South learning exchanges can support national efforts.  

In conclusion, while middle-income countries have greater means to invest in their populations, poverty persists due to high inequality, uneven growth and lack of comprehensive policy approaches. Ending poverty will require universal, rights-based social protection systems, inclusive growth policies, and targeted investments for marginalized groups. With political will and a renewed commitment to leave no one behind, ending extreme poverty in middle-income countries is possible. But the clock is ticking to achieve this urgent goal and fulfill the promise of the 2030 Agenda.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on SDG 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) targeting an expert audience and focused on middle-income countries:

SDG 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere 

Progress on SDG 1 in the Asia-Pacific region, especially middle-income countries, has been uneven. While extreme poverty has declined, pockets of poverty persist, income inequality is rising, and economic growth has slowed in some countries. 

Target 1.1: By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day.
In East and North-East Asia, extreme poverty rates are very low, under 3% in most countries. However, in South and South-West Asia, extreme poverty rates remain high, between 12 to 15% in countries like India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, home to the majority of the region's poor. While progress has been made, at current rates of decline, several countries will not eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.

Target 1.2: By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions.  
Most countries have national poverty lines higher than $1.25/day. Using these lines, upper middle-income countries in East Asia like China, Malaysia and Thailand have poverty rates between 1 to 6%. However, in South Asia, poverty rates remain between 10 to 30% in countries like India, Pakistan, and Indonesia, according to national poverty lines. At current rates of decline, meeting target 1.2 will be challenging for several countries. 

Target 1.3: Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.  
Social protection systems in the region are uneven and fragmented. Middle-income countries like China, Thailand and Mongolia have broad coverage of social insurance like pensions, healthcare and unemployment benefits. However, other middle-income countries like India, Pakistan and Indonesia have limited coverage. Marginalized groups like informal workers, migrants and persons with disabilities often lack access to social protection. Expanding social protection systems and floors may be difficult for some countries given fiscal constraints.    

[The response continues with analysis on other SDG 1 targets and indicators, citing statistics and examples from different middle-income countries in the Asia-Pacific region...]

In conclusion, while extreme poverty has declined in middle-income countries in Asia and the Pacific,  many countries need to accelerate progress to eradicate poverty in all its dimensions by 2030. Expanding social protection, addressing inequality, and boosting job creation and economic growth, while overcoming fiscal constraints, will be critical to making the SDG 1 ambition a reality across the region. Overall, regional cooperation and partnerships will be key to supporting countries in achieving SDG 1.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 1 (No Poverty) in the style of ESCWA targeting an expert audience with a focus on middle income countries:

The reduction of poverty remains a core priority in the ESCWA region. Progress on SDG 1 has been uneven across the Arab countries of the region, with middle-income countries showing promising results in recent years but still significant challenges remaining.  

The multidimensional nature of poverty in the region requires a coordinated policy response across sectors. Income poverty rates have been declining in upper middle-income countries, aided by economic diversification and job growth outside of the extractives sector. However, income inequality remains a persistent challenge and poverty is increasingly concentrated in rural areas. Access to basic services and social protections also remain uneven, with many still lacking access to healthcare, education, housing, and social safety nets. 

Macroeconomic policies that promote growth and job creation will be key to continued progress. Diversifying economies beyond oil and gas will generate employment in new sectors. Education and skills training programs aligned with the needs of growing industries can prepare those to access these new opportunities. However, economic growth alone is not sufficient; social spending and strengthened safety nets are also necessary to lift the poorest segments of the population and reduce vulnerability to economic shocks. Conditional cash transfers, unemployment benefits, and healthcare subsidies have been effective tools where implemented. 

Access to finance also remains a barrier and should be addressed through expanded microfinance programs and development of capital markets accessible to SMEs. Digital finance and fintech solutions can help reach poorer and more rural populations with limited access to traditional banking. Financial inclusion contributes to resilience and the ability to invest in health, education and business opportunities to escape poverty.

Partnerships across government, private sector and civil society will be key to formulating policy solutions tailored to the nuances of poverty in each country context. National statistical offices should be strengthened to provide data for evidence-based anti-poverty policies. And increased cooperation is needed within the region to share best practices. With concerted action, the region can make substantial progress in achieving the ambitious targets of SDG 1. But political will and priority must translate into budgetary allocations and policy changes for the poorest segments of the population. Tackling long-standing inequalities and vulnerabilities will be required to truly achieve the end of poverty.


 Here is a draft analytical report on SDG 1 (No Poverty) in the style of UN DESA:

SDG 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere  

Progress towards ending extreme poverty has been encouraging, with the global extreme poverty rate declining to under 10 percent in 2015 according to World Bank estimates. However, the pace of poverty reduction has been uneven across regions and countries. Least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS) continue to face significant challenges in eradicating extreme poverty.  

In LDCs, over 43 percent of the population still live in extreme poverty. Factors such as dependence on agricultural and commodity exports, limited economic diversification, poor infrastructure, and high costs of trade continue to limit inclusive growth and job creation. LDCs will require sustained high levels of investment in human and physical capital as well as social protection programs to lift millions out of poverty. UNCTAD estimates LDCs will require annual investment of $140-170 billion to meet the SDGs. 

LLDCs face high trade and transport costs due to lack of sea access, impacting export competitiveness and economic growth. The average cost of exporting a container in LLDCs is two-thirds higher than the world average. Infrastructure development and trade facilitation measures are urgently needed to reduce high costs of trade that contribute to poverty. Regional cooperation on trade, transport and transit could significantly boost trade and growth in LLDCs.

In SIDS, poverty tends to be exacerbated by remoteness, narrow resource bases, and vulnerability to external shocks such as natural disasters, climate change and economic crises. Remittances and tourism comprise large shares of GDP in many SIDS, highlighting vulnerability to global economic conditions. Building resilience and investing in sustainable economic diversification are critical for sustainable development and poverty reduction in SIDS. Access to finance and technology transfer are also essential.

This report provides an overview of the major challenges in ending poverty in LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS. Addressing poverty in these vulnerable groups will require focused policies and support adapted to their unique structural constraints and vulnerabilities. With targeted investments, cooperation and an enabling global environment, significant progress can be made to lift these populations out of poverty and ensure no one is left behind. But greater ambition and political will are urgently needed to meet the immense task of ending poverty in all its dimensions.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the UN DESA Division for Eradication of Absolute Poverty (EAPD):

Progress on Sustainable Development Goal 1: Ending Absolute Poverty  

Absolute poverty remains a stark reality for hundreds of millions of people around the world, especially in least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS). According to the World Bank, about 736 million people lived in extreme poverty in 2015, surviving on less than $1.90 per day. While the proportion of people living in extreme poverty declined from 19% to 10% from 1990 to 2015, the rate of decline has slowed in recent years and the COVID-19 pandemic risks reversing decades of progress. 

LDCs account for a large share of those living in extreme poverty, with over 250 million in extreme poverty. They face significant challenges to achieving SDG 1, including limited economic growth, inequality, dependency on commodity exports, conflict and climate change impacts. Many have poverty rates near or above 30%. LLDCs like Nepal or Zimbabwe also struggle with remoteness from global markets, lack of access to sea transport and high trade costs. SIDS have vulnerabilities like small populations, limited natural resources, and exposure to natural disasters that constrain poverty reduction.  

To achieve SDG 1, accelerated action is needed through coordinated policies, investments, technology and partnerships. The UN’s Committee for Development Policy recommends LDCs improve productive capacity, build resilience, and invest in human capital and infrastructure. For SIDS, key priorities include sustainable tourism, renewable energy, and debt relief. LLDCs would benefit from regional cooperation on trade and strengthening transport links. developed countries must provide increased aid, debt relief, and technology transfer.

Multilateral support has had successes, but more can be done. UNDP’s poverty reduction programs have supported over 50 million people, but funding is still lacking relative to need. UNCTAD’s work on debt relief and building productive capacity must expand. The UN regional commissions have pushed for South-South cooperation, financial inclusion and social protection policies, but their impact would increase with more funding and political will from member states.

In conclusion, while progress has been made in reducing extreme poverty, accelerated action is urgently needed to achieve SDG 1, especially in vulnerable countries. Success will require political commitment to evidence-based policies, scaled up financing, strengthened multilateral support, and partnerships at global, regional and national levels. Ending poverty will be challenging, but is critical to sustainable development. With dedicated action, we can achieve a world free from absolute poverty.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), targeting an expert audience:

Progress on Sustainable Development Goal 1: Ending Poverty  
  
Eradicating extreme poverty remains one of the greatest challenges facing the global community as we advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. According to the latest estimates, over 700 million people still live in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $1.90 per day. The majority of the extreme poor live in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, including many in the least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs).  
  
To assess progress on SDG 1, we must examine trends in key indicators like the proportion of the population living below the international poverty line, the poverty gap ratio, and the share of the poorest quintile in each country’s income. Across these measures, there is uneven progress that demands urgent action. For example, while extreme poverty has declined in LDCs over the past decade, the pace of reduction is too slow to meet the SDG 1 targets.  Poverty remains entrenched in many LDCs, especially in those facing fragility, conflict, and crisis. Targeted investments in social protection, healthcare, education, sustainable agriculture, and resilient infrastructure are critically needed.  

Conflict and fragility also pose major challenges for ending poverty in SIDS and LLDCs. Economic vulnerability, lack of economic diversification, and high unemployment create poverty traps. Many SIDS and LLDCs also face economic instability from climate change and natural disasters, underscoring the importance of building resilience.  

To accelerate progress, scaled-up support from development partners is essential. Official development assistance (ODA) and other financial flows need to be sustainable, help countries strengthen domestic resource mobilization, and target the populations and geographic areas most in need. South-South cooperation can also provide important resources and share best practices for poverty reduction.   

In conclusion, while the long-term trend shows extreme poverty is declining globally, we are not on track to meet SDG 1. Urgent, coordinated global action is required to lift millions out of poverty, especially in the poorest and most vulnerable countries. By investing in inclusive, sustainable economic growth and empowering the extreme poor, we can end poverty in all its dimensions and ensure no one is left behind. But we must act now to change the course of progress and achieve this critical goal.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the UN DESA Division for Inclusive Social Development targeting an expert audience:

SDG 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere – Progress and challenges in least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries 

While global poverty rates have declined over the past decades, poverty remains a persistent challenge, especially in vulnerable countries. According to the latest estimates, about 736 million people still live in extreme poverty, especially concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. Vulnerable groups like least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries face particular difficulties in eradicating poverty due to their inherent structural disadvantages, geographical handicaps, and high vulnerability to external shocks.

Least developed countries (LDCs) remain far behind in achieving SDG 1 targets, with extreme poverty rates of over 40% on average. Poverty in LDCs is exacerbated by lack of economic diversification, low agricultural productivity, high population growth rates, and lack of access to basic infrastructure and technology. LDCs will require sustained high growth, increased productive capacity, expanded social safety nets, and targeted pro-poor interventions to make progress on SDG 1. Access to concessional finance, aid for trade, and improved global market access are also key to support poverty reduction in LDCs.

Small island developing states (SIDS) face significant challenges in reducing poverty due to their small size, geographical isolation, and high vulnerability to natural disasters and external economic shocks. While poverty rates in SIDS have declined, pockets of extreme poverty persist, especially in less developed Pacific and Caribbean SIDS. Growth in SIDS remains below world averages, inequality is rising, decent work deficits abound, and essential public services are lacking in many islands. SIDS will require scaled-up social protection, investments in disaster resilience, inclusive growth strategies, and sustainable tourism development to reduce poverty. They also need support to access development financing on affordable terms.  

Landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) struggle with high poverty rates due to lack of territorial access to the sea, remoteness from major markets, and high transit costs. Poverty in LLDCs is worsened by lack of connectivity, low productive capacity, and heavy dependence on commodities exports.  Trading with neighbors and overseas markets is difficult for LLDCs, so they rely heavily on transit countries, often paying high cost mark-ups. Investments in transport infrastructure, trade facilitation, export diversification, and structural transformation are key for LLDCs to reduce poverty sustainably. Regional cooperation and integration are also vital for LLDCs to gain greater access to key ports and trade routes.

Overall, the key challenges for vulnerable countries in eradicating poverty are lack of economic diversification and high dependence on ODA; vulnerability to shocks including natural disasters, conflicts, health crises and economic downturns; lack of access to essential infrastructure and new technologies; high inequality and inequitable growth; lack of social safety nets and basic services; and lack of access to affordable development finance. Concerted action is required by governments, donors and international organizations to support poverty reduction in these vulnerable states through increased investments in key SDG 1 priority areas. Vulnerable countries will also require improved access to overseas markets, new financing options, strengthened resilience and expanded social protection to make progress towards ending poverty in all its dimensions by 2030.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the UN Division for Sustainable Development Goals:

SDG 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere 

Progress on ending poverty remains uneven across regions and countries. Least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries continue to face significant challenges in eradicating extreme poverty. 

In LDCs, the poverty rate is still very high at 38% in 2018, though it has declined from 47% in 2004. The COVID-19 pandemic is projected to push an additional 32 million people into extreme poverty in LDCs. Small island developing states have also seen a rise in poverty rates, linked to the impacts of climate change like rising sea levels, coastal erosion, and natural disasters which negatively impact tourism, fisheries, and agriculture. For the group of small island developing states as a whole, the extreme poverty rate is 24%, though for some countries like Haiti it is as high as 61%. Landlocked developing countries typically have higher poverty rates due to geographic isolation and lack of access to international trade routes and ports. The poverty rate for this group is 33% with extreme poverty concentrated in Africa, though it has declined from over 50% in 2004. 

Accelerating poverty reduction in these vulnerable country groups will require targeted action and global support. Developed countries must honor their commitments to LDCs including providing 0.2% of GNI as ODA. Small island developing states urgently need increased access to climate finance and support for resilience, adaptation and disaster risk reduction. Landlocked developing countries would benefit from infrastructure development to improve transit corridors and trade routes. For all groups, social protection programs, quality education and healthcare, rural development, and job creation are key.   

At the current rate of poverty reduction, the world will not reach the ambitious target of ending extreme poverty for all people everywhere by 2030. Concerted action is needed through increased financing, policy support, technology transfer and global partnerships that target the most vulnerable groups and fragile states. Ending poverty is a moral imperative and foundational goal that underpins sustainable development. Accelerated progress on SDG 1 is critical for the achievement of the entire 2030 Agenda. Overall, while extreme poverty rates continue to decline globally, the world remains far from achieving the vision of zero poverty within this decade without transformative change. But with political will and global solidarity, ending poverty in least developed countries, small island developing states and landlocked developing countries can be achieved.


 Here is a draft long-form analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty) in the requested style:

Sustainable Development Goal 1: Progress and Challenges in Eradicating Extreme Poverty  

Sustainable Development Goal 1 aims to eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere by 2030. This goal includes targets on reducing at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions; implementing nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable; and ensuring that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance.  

Progress has been made in reducing extreme poverty, but it remains a monumental challenge particularly in least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing states. The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to reverse decades of progress in poverty reduction. According to the Secretary-General's 2020 SDG progress report, the pandemic could push up to 115 million people into extreme poverty in 2020, with total incomes declining by $4 trillion. This would mark the first rise in global poverty since 1998. Targeted investments in sustainable development are urgently needed to counter these effects.

In least developed countries, the poverty rate declined from 2010 to 2015 but still remains very high at over 30 percent. Even prior to COVID-19, extreme poverty was projected to persist in least developed countries through at least 2030 according to UNCTAD. Small island developing states face severe economic vulnerability, climate change impacts and environmental degradation that make poverty eradication particularly challenging. Many landlocked developing countries have poverty rates above 30 percent with high economic vulnerability. 

Achieving SDG 1 will require a redoubling of efforts from the international community to support the poorest and most vulnerable countries through increased Official Development Assistance, debt relief, improved market access for exports and technology transfer on concessional terms. Domestically, countries will need to strengthen social protection systems, improve financial inclusion, invest in sustainable agricultural development and education, and promote inclusive economic growth with net job creation, especially for youth and women. Tackling poverty will also require progress on other SDGs like health, education, gender equality and infrastructure. 

With concerted global actions and through national sustainable development strategies, achieving SDG 1 by 2030 is feasible, but the sobering reality of the extreme poverty that remains demands rapid action and long-term commitment to leave no one behind. Overall, with ten years left to achieve the SDGs, we are falling short in progress on eradicating extreme poverty and must urgently accelerate efforts towards an inclusive, sustainable and resilient future for all.


 Here is a draft long fictional analytical report in the style of UNDP on SDG 1 (No Poverty) with a focus on least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS) and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs):

Progress on SDG 1: Ending Poverty in the World's Most Vulnerable Countries  

While global poverty rates have declined steadily over the past few decades, the world's poorest and most vulnerable countries continue to struggle in the fight against extreme poverty. According to the latest estimates, over 1 billion people still live in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $1.90 per day. The majority reside in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, with poverty rates remaining persistently high in LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs.  

In LDCs, nearly half the population lives in extreme poverty. Poverty rates are highest in nations like Burundi, Central African Republic and South Sudan where violent conflict has devastated economies and livelihoods. While economic growth has been robust in some LDCs like Bangladesh, Myanmar and Tanzania, the benefits have not reached the poorest segments of the population. Lack of access to essential services, conflicts, climate change impacts, governance challenges along with economic and political fragility are key obstacles. Targeted investments in social services, job creation, agricultural development and disaster risk reduction are urgently needed to lift more people out of poverty.  

For SIDS, the existential threat of climate change poses severe challenges for poverty eradication and sustainable development. Sea level rise, coastal degradation, more intense storms are damaging infrastructure, economies and food security in islands like Kiribati, Maldives and Tuvalu. Although SIDS have a higher GDP per capita than LDCs, poverty and inequality are high due to their small size, isolation and vulnerability. Building resilience, transitioning to renewable energy and sustainable tourism, while improving access to health and education are key priorities to reduce poverty.

In LLDCs, the lack of territorial access to the sea, remoteness and isolation from world markets have hindered progress on poverty reduction. 32% of the population lives in extreme poverty, with rates over 50-70% in some LLDCs like Burundi, Ethiopia and Nepal. Investing in transport connectivity, trade facilitation and integration, agricultural development as well as cooperation with transit countries are crucial to boost economic growth, job creation and poverty reduction in LLDCs.

Overall, while extreme poverty has declined in many parts of the world, it remains a harsh reality for hundreds of millions in the most vulnerable countries. Targeted policies and investments to promote sustainable pro-poor development pathways, in line with the SDGs, are urgently needed to ensure that no one is left behind. With just 10 years left to achieve the SDGs, now is the time for renewed action to end poverty.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty) in the style of UNCTAD:

Progress on SDG 1: Ending poverty in the most vulnerable countries  

While global poverty rates have declined remarkably over the past few decades, progress has been uneven across regions and countries. Least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS) continue to grapple with high rates of extreme poverty due to their unique structural challenges and vulnerabilities. According to the latest estimates, over half of the extreme poor live in LDCs and LLDCs, even though they only account for about 14% of the world’s population.  

The multidimensional nature of poverty is most acute in LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS. Lack of access to basic services, infrastructure, decent work opportunities, and economic and political empowerment all mutually reinforce each other in these countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has also dealt an unprecedented blow to their economies, wiping out years of hard-won development gains. Global extreme poverty is projected to rise for the first time in over 20 years due to the crisis. LDCs and SIDS are likely to be hit the hardest.   

Targeted interventions are urgently needed to get progress in the most vulnerable countries back on track. Short-term measures should focus on protecting lives and livelihoods through social safety nets, ensuring access to healthcare and vaccinations, and providing relief to businesses to prevent wide-scale bankruptcies and job losses. In the long run, more investments are needed in sustainable and resilient infrastructure, renewable energy, education and skilling, and women’s economic empowerment. Building productive capacities and economic diversification will also be key to reducing vulnerabilities to external shocks.  

Regional cooperation and private sector partnerships have an important role to play. South-South cooperation, for example, can help LDCs and LLDCs overcome geographic and economic isolation. Partnerships with private tech companies and impact investors may facilitate the adoption of digital technologies for e-commerce, e-health, and e-learning. Debt relief and an expansion of LDC-specific trade preferences would provide fiscal space and market access for a green, inclusive economic recovery.

On the whole, ending poverty will require an integrated, systemic approach that tackles both the symptoms as well as the root causes of deprivation in the most vulnerable countries. With global solidarity and cooperation, it is possible to build a more just and sustainable future where no one is left behind. But the time for action is now. The costs of inaction in the face of compounding crises are just too great. Together, we must rise to the challenge of our time and ensure that the poorest nations and peoples of the world are able to improve their lives and livelihoods.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Africa on Sustainable Development Goal 1: No Poverty:

Sustainable Development Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere 

Progress on SDG 1 in Africa remains uneven but promising. According to estimates from the World Bank, the extreme poverty rate in Sub-Saharan Africa has declined from 57% in 1990 to 41% in 2015, lifting over 230 million people out of extreme poverty. However, due to population growth, the absolute number of people living in extreme poverty has actually increased from 280 million in 1990 to over 400 million in 2015. Significant challenges remain to eradicate extreme poverty in Africa, especially in least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS) that face particular economic vulnerabilities. 

In LDCs, over 45% of the population still live in extreme poverty. Poverty rates are declining too slowly to meet SDG 1 targets, in part due to lack of economic opportunity, environmental degradation, conflict and climate change impacts. Targeted efforts are needed to promote inclusive growth, build resilience, and help the most vulnerable escape poverty. Landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) face additional challenges accessing global markets due to geographical disadvantages. They require investments in transport infrastructure and trade facilitation to unlock economic potential.  

SIDS face high costs for essential goods and services due to remoteness and exposure to natural disasters. With limited natural resources and narrow production bases, SIDS economies are highly vulnerable to external shocks. Adaptation and mitigation of climate change effects are urgently needed to curb poverty in SIDS. Development partners must increase official development assistance and promote debt relief, trade preferences,  and technology transfer for these disadvantaged country groups.

Within countries, poverty remains highly concentrated among marginalized groups including women, youth, persons with disabilities, and displaced populations. Discrimination and lack of access to resources and economic opportunity have disproportionately affected these groups. Targeted policy action is required to promote inclusion and address multidimensional poverty. With political will, peer learning, and strong partnerships, ending poverty in all its dimensions can be made a reality in Africa, especially for its most vulnerable peoples and places. But accelerated progress is urgently needed to meet the ambitious SDG 1 targets in just over a decade. This will require localized data and evidence, policy innovation, and scaled up investments across sectors to lift the furthest behind first.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on SDG 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Europe, targeting an expert audience and with a focus on least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries:

The first Sustainable Development Goal aims to "end poverty in all its forms everywhere" by 2030. This is an ambitious goal that will require coordinated global effort to achieve, especially for vulnerable groups of countries like least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries. 

For least developed countries (LDCs), extreme poverty remains widespread. According to the UN, around 43% of people in LDCs live in extreme poverty. Poverty in LDCs is exacerbated by a lack of structural economic transformation, limited productive capacity, rapid population growth, vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters, and political instability. LDCs will need substantial investment in infrastructure, education, healthcare, social protection programs, and economic diversification to reduce poverty. Many LDCs also need debt relief and aid to fund national poverty reduction strategies.

Small island developing states (SIDS) face unique challenges to reducing poverty due to their small size, geographical isolation, and vulnerability to climate change impacts like sea level rise and extreme weather events. Tourism dominates many SIDS economies, but the tourism industry was devastated in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, worsening poverty. Many SIDS will need to rebuild more diverse, resilient economies and strengthen social safety nets to lift people out of poverty. Some may also require debt relief and grants to fund these efforts.

For landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), lack of territorial access to the sea, isolation from world markets, and high transit costs hamper trade and economic growth, exacerbating poverty. Poverty tends to be concentrated in rural areas of LLDCs. Investing in infrastructure like roads and railways to facilitate trade, promoting agricultural development, expanding access to education and healthcare, and strengthening trade relationships with neighbors can help reduce poverty for LLDCs. Regional cooperation on issues like trade facilitation and infrastructure development may also benefit LLDCs.

In summary, while global poverty has declined in recent decades, vulnerable country groups like LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs continue to struggle with high rates of extreme poverty and require targeted investments and partnerships to achieve SDG 1. With political will, increased aid, disaster risk reduction, and policies centered on inclusive and sustainable economic growth, ending poverty in these country groups is possible by 2030. But the challenge is vast, and the international community must step up support for these vulnerable populations to meet this critical goal.


 Here is a draft long analytical report in the style of ECLAC on progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty) with a focus on least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries:

Progress towards SDG 1 in Vulnerable Countries: An ECLAC Perspective 

Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains an immense challenge, especially in the world's most vulnerable countries. Least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries face severe structural barriers to achieving SDG 1 including lack of connectivity, high costs of trade, climate change impacts, over-dependence on a few commodities for export, lack of economic diversification, and remoteness from major global markets.

In the Least Developed Countries, nearly half the population still lives in extreme poverty. Poverty rates remain well over 30% in many LDCs in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. While extreme poverty has declined in LDCs over the past decade, the rate of progress is too slow to meet the targets of SDG 1. Significant investments in agriculture, education, health, and job creation will be needed to lift more people out of poverty. Many LDCs also need to improve domestic resource mobilization to fund social programs and sustainable development. 

Small Island Developing States face high costs for basic necessities like food and energy due to their remoteness and small size. Many SIDS have poverty rates over 30% and lack economic opportunities for their citizens. The tourism sector has been a major driver of growth in some SIDS but remains vulnerable to external shocks. Climate change poses an existential threat to many SIDS, and adaptation measures divert funds away from social programs. Debt distress also remains an issue for many SIDS, limiting fiscal space. 

Landlocked Developing Countries often face high trade costs due to lack of territorial access to the sea and transit dependence on neighboring countries. Poverty rates remain high in many LLDCs, over 30% in more than a dozen countries. LLDCs need to invest in connectivity infrastructure like roads and railways to facilitate trade and mobility. Regional cooperation on trade facilitation and harmonization of customs procedures can help reduce trade costs for LLDCs. Diversifying economies beyond a reliance on primary commodities is also key for poverty reduction.

In summary, while extreme poverty has declined globally, progress has been uneven and many of the world's poorest remain in vulnerable countries. Addressing the structural barriers these countries face is critical for achieving SDG 1. Increased investments in agriculture, education, healthcare and infrastructure can lift more people out of poverty if coupled with policy reforms, improved governance, and in some cases debt relief or restructuring. Regional cooperation and global partnerships will also be instrumental to supporting the poorest and most vulnerable on the path towards sustainable development.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty) in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) targeting an expert audience:

Sustainable Development Goal 1: Progress and Challenges in Reducing Poverty in Asia and the Pacific  

Asia and the Pacific has made steady progress in reducing extreme poverty over the past decade. The proportion of people living on less than $1.90 per day declined from 19.5% in 2010 to 11.2% in 2015, helping the region achieve Target 1.1 of the Sustainable Development Goals ahead of schedule. However, this progress has been uneven across countries and subregions. Poverty rates remain high in the Pacific island developing states, South and South-West Asia, and parts of South-East Asia. In many least developed countries, nearly half the population still lives in extreme poverty.  

The COVID-19 pandemic has threatened to reverse years of progress in poverty reduction. Preliminary estimates indicate the crisis could push up to 77 million people back into extreme poverty in Asia and the Pacific, in addition to the 399 million who were already living in extreme poverty before the onset of the pandemic. The economic contraction, loss of jobs and livelihoods, and lack of social safety nets in many countries have contributed to increasing poverty and hardship, especially in informal sectors. Targeted policy responses have provided temporary relief, but more needs to be done to build resilience and accelerate progress towards Goal 1.

Despite the setbacks, poverty reduction remains achievable if adequate measures are put in place. Key recommendations include: 

1. Expand and extend social protection coverage, including temporary income support and unemployment benefits for vulnerable groups. Countries should aim for universal social protection guided by ILO Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202).

2. Increase public spending on essential services like healthcare, education, water and sanitation. Additional resources should be focused on least developed countries and small island developing states with limited fiscal capacity. 

3. Support sectors that disproportionately employ the poor, such as agriculture, tourism, and textiles. This could include subsidies, loans, skills training, and job creation programs targeted at small and medium enterprises. 

4. Provide concessional financial and technical support for the poorest countries to invest in the Sustainable Development Goals. Development partners should meet long-standing commitments to official development assistance and debt sustainability frameworks.  

With renewed commitment to inclusive, sustainable growth and cooperation on multiple fronts, Asia and the Pacific can get back on track to end poverty in all its forms. But the window for action is closing fast, and the rest of the decade will be crucial in shaping trajectories for decades to come. Urgent action is needed to protect hard-won gains and ensure a future of shared prosperity across this diverse and dynamic region.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 1 (No Poverty) in the style of ESCWA targeting an expert audience:

SDG 1: Progress and Challenges in Ending Poverty in the Arab Region  

The eradication of poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing the Arab region today. While some countries have made progress in reducing income poverty, poverty rates remain stubbornly high in others, especially in least developed countries (LDCs) and countries affected by conflict. The COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences have further exacerbated poverty across the region, threatening to undo years of progress.  

Income poverty: The proportion of people living in extreme poverty (under $1.90 per day) in the Arab region was estimated at 5.5% in 2015, however this figure masks wide disparities across countries. Several Gulf countries have effectively eradicated extreme poverty, but rates are much higher in conflict-affected countries like Yemen (over 40%) and Sudan (over 20%), as well as Comoros and Djibouti (both over 30%). Poverty rates are also typically higher in rural areas and among marginalized groups like women, youth and refugees.  

Multidimensional poverty: Income is but one dimension of poverty. Many in the region also lack access to basic services like healthcare, education, electricity, sanitation and social protection. The 2019 Arab Multidimensional Poverty Report found that 28.5% of the region’s population suffers from multidimensional poverty, with rates over 50% in Comoros, Djibouti, Mauritania, Sudan, and Yemen. Addressing non-income aspects of poverty will be critical for achieving SDG 1.  

Vulnerable groups: LDCs, small island developing states (SIDS) and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) face additional challenges in ending poverty due to their geographical locations and constraints. Countries like Yemen, Comoros and Djibouti are all classified as LDCs, SIDS or both, explaining their high poverty rates. Conflict and forced displacement have also made poverty more widespread; over 80% of refugees from Syria, Yemen and Sudan live below the poverty line. 

Economic challenges: Weak economic growth, fiscal constraints, inequality, and economic mismanagement have hampered poverty reduction efforts. Per capita GDP growth has been slow or even declined in some countries. Government spending on social services and infrastructure is low. Inequality has risen in some countries, limiting the benefits of growth for the poor. Corruption and inefficient institutions also weaken the impact of policies and programs meant to help the poor.  

Policy recommendations: Accelerating poverty reduction in the region will require policies focused on inclusive economic growth, targeted social protection, and support for vulnerable groups. Countries should invest in education, healthcare and job creation for youth and women. They should establish social safety nets including universal basic income schemes and expand cash transfer programs. Development partners must provide debt relief and increase aid for countries most in need. Empowering refugees and addressing root causes of displacement are also key. Achieving SDG 1 will demand political will, regional cooperation and a shared commitment to leaving no one behind.
