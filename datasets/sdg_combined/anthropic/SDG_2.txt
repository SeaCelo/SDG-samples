Progress on Ending Hunger Remains Slow Amid Myriad Challenges

By the Assistant

Ending hunger and malnutrition around the world by 2030 remains an immense challenge, according to a new report by the United Nations Secretary-General. While some progress has been made toward achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2, addressing issues like climate change, inequality, and conflict are critical to accelerating progress. 

SDG 2 aims to "end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture" around the world over the next decade. According to the report, the number of undernourished people has dropped to around 821 million in recent years, but hunger is on the rise in some parts of Africa, and malnutrition remains a pressing issue globally. Climate change, socioeconomic inequalities, lack of agricultural investment, and protracted crises including conflict have undermined food systems and made populations vulnerable to hunger.

"While some of the world's poorest countries have made progress, we are not on track to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030," said UN Secretary-General António Guterres. Achieving the goal will require addressing the root causes that leave populations food insecure, including gender inequality, lack of economic opportunity, and lack of access to resources like land, credit, and agricultural inputs. It will also require major investments in sustainable food production systems and support for smallholder farmers. 

The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has warned that agricultural investments and innovation must increase significantly to meet the food needs of a population projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050. Climate change threatens to cut crop yields and worsen food insecurity. According to a recent FAO report, the number of undernourished people could increase by up to 132 million by 2030 due to the effects of climate change on agriculture. The FAO is calling for transformations in agricultural and food systems through technology adoption, reduced food loss and waste, and more sustainable and nutrition-focused production methods.

Progress on SDG 2 Remains Uneven As World Hunger Rises Again

The second Sustainable Development Goal aims to achieve zero hunger by 2030. According to  the latest UN report on progress toward the SDGs, the world is not on track to meet SDG 2 targets and hunger is on the rise again after decades of progress. While some regions have made headway in reducing chronic malnutrition and stunting, food insecurity has intensified in parts of Africa, Latin America and Western Asia.

The number of people going hungry has been increasing since 2014 according to the UN's State of Food Security and Nutrition report. After declining for decades, over 820 million people were undernourished in 2018. Extreme hunger also rose in about 20 countries that are home to over 113 million undernourished people. Conflict, climate change, and economic downturns were the main drivers of this reversal according to David Beasley, Executive Director of the World Food Programme. 

 Africa remains the region with the highest prevalence of undernourishment according to the UN’s Economic and Social Council. While Asia has the largest total number of undernourished people, the situation has improved in recent years. Latin America has also seen a rise in hunger due to economic crises. The ECOSOC has called for reinvigorating investment in agriculture, improving market access for small-scale farmers, and assisting members states in strengthening their social safety nets to reduce hunger.

However, some progress has been achieved in reducing child malnutrition according to UNICEF. The percentage of children under 5 who are stunted or wasted has declined, but 150.8 million children under 5 still suffer from stunting. UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore has said “exclusive breastfeeding and improved access to nutritious food have the potential to save many lives, yet investment in these critical areas remains far too low.” She called on governments and private sector partners to promote breastfeeding and fund programmes targeting malnutrition.

While the Zero Hunger goal faces significant challenges, achieving it would have major benefits according to UN DESA. Ending hunger could boost global GDP by $1.9 trillion per year by 2030 and lead to greater food security, improved nutrition, and enhanced agricultural productivity. UN DESA Under-Secretary-General Liu Zhenmin has urged countries to accelerate progress by promoting sustainable food systems, improving food distribution infrastructure, and assisting smallholder farmers. With only 10 years left to achieve the SDGs, the world must rededicate efforts to ensure everyone has access to safe and nutritious food.

Progress on SDG 2: Zero Hunger Remains Uneven

The second Sustainable Development Goal aims to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. According to the latest report from the UN Secretary-General, while some regions have made progress, hunger rates remain high around the world and progress needs to accelerate to achieve the targets under SDG 2.

Ending hunger remains an immense challenge. The number of undernourished people has risen from 784 million in 2015 to over 821 million in 2017, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization. Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia continue to have the highest hunger rates, with 1 in 4 people undernourished in those regions. Conflict and climate change-related events threaten to further exacerbate hunger crises in vulnerable regions. Achieving zero hunger will require political will, partnerships, and increased investments to tackle the root causes of hunger.

Improving food security and nutrition is closely tied to creating sustainable food systems and resilient agricultural practices. The share of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture has increased in some regions according to the UN report, but much more needs to be done to reduce reliance on chemical fertilizers and promote biodiversity. Nutrition programs also need greater funding and policy support to provide healthy and nutritious diets for all. No region is on track to fully meet global nutrition targets.

Ending hunger and all forms of malnutrition is an immense task that requires collaboration across borders and sectors. But as the UN Secretary-General has said, "zero hunger is about more than food security—it is about building sustainable societies." Significant investments in sustainable agriculture, improvements in rural infrastructure, increases in productivity, and trade supports for developing countries are some of the actions that could put the world on track to achieve zero hunger, lifting millions of people out of poverty and creating a more sustainable future for all. Overall progress is uneven, but with a concerted global effort across government, business and non-profits, achieving SDG 2 is possible within our lifetimes.

SDG 2: The Long Road to Ending Global Hunger  

By Your Assistant

Ending hunger and achieving food security for all people around the world remains an immense challenge. According to the latest estimates from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), about 821 million people worldwide suffered from hunger in 2018. While this shows some progress from over 900 million hungry in 2000, the pace of decline has slowed in recent years and is not fast enough to meet the Sustainable Development Goal target of zero hunger by 2030. 

Much work remains to overhaul food systems and support smallholder farmers. The agriculture sector, which employs over 1 billion people worldwide, is under threat from climate change impacts like rising temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events. Smallholder farmers, who produce over 80% of the world's food, are particularly vulnerable given their dependence on rain-fed agriculture and lack of resources to adapt.

Investing in sustainable agriculture and rural development is key. Projects that promote climate-smart agriculture, efficient irrigation, and renewable energy access for farmers can help boost yields and resilience. Governments and donors must also put greater focus on supporting smallholder farmers, who face immense challenges accessing land, inputs, financing, and markets. Improving transportation infrastructure and food distribution networks is critical to reducing post-harvest losses and ensuring surpluses reach those most in need. 

Ending hunger will require partnerships across sectors. Governments, civil society, the private sector, and the UN must work together to implement agricultural policies and programs aligned with the SDGs. Greater cooperation is also needed to address the root causes of food insecurity, including poverty, inequality, and conflict. No one organization or sector can tackle these complex, interlinked challenges alone.

There have been some promising efforts. Many countries have incorporated zero hunger targets into national development plans. The UN's Committee on World Food Security is facilitating multi-stakeholder partnerships. Private sector food companies have pledged to improve nutrition and cut waste. But much more political will and investment is needed to transform food systems, advance sustainable agriculture, and meet the ambition of SDG 2. With only 10 years left until 2030, the time for action is now. Together, we must accelerate progress to build a just, equitable and sustainable food future for all.

Progress on Zero Hunger Remains Uneven Globally

By Your Assistant

The second Sustainable Development Goal aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. According to the latest report by the UN Secretary-General, progress remains uneven across regions and countries, with some successes but also some areas of stagnation or deterioration. 

In Asia and the Pacific, the region has achieved steady declines in undernourishment and stunting over the past decades. However, it still remains home to nearly two thirds of the world's undernourished people. In Southern Asia in particular, nearly 1 in 3 children under 5 years of age still suffer from stunting. Africa also struggles with high rates of hunger, with 1 in 3 people in sub-Saharan Africa facing hunger. Conflict and climate change in parts of Africa threaten further progress. The Arab region has also seen a rise in undernourishment in recent years, linked to conflicts and economic crises.  

On the other hand, Latin America and the Caribbean have made substantial progress in reducing hunger. Undernourishment affects less than 7% of the population, while stunting affects only 8.4% of children under 5, close to the global nutrition target. National policies promoting family farming, school feeding programs and conditional cash transfers have contributed to these successes. Overall, 63 out of 113 countries monitored by FAO have achieved the target of halving the percentage of undernourished people.

To accelerate progress, the UN calls for strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity to climate change, conflicts and economic crises. This includes targeted investments in sustainable agriculture, including support for small-scale food producers. Social protection programs should also be expanded to provide food and nutrition support to vulnerable populations. At the global level, more efforts are needed to limit disruptions to trade and make food and agricultural markets function well. Overall, ending hunger will require a collaborative effort across sectors and partners at global, regional and local levels to build sustainable food systems and implement the 2030 Agenda. But as the uneven progress shows, much work remains across all regions to achieve Zero Hunger in the next decade.


 Here is a draft Op-ed in the style of Nicholas Kristoff on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger):

The Scourge of Hunger Persists: Why We Must Do More for SDG 2 

As I sit here at my computer, my stomach full from a hearty breakfast, it's sobering to reflect that nearly 690 million people worldwide still go to bed hungry each night. Despite progress on other fronts, hunger remains one of the most persistent evils in our world and demands far more attention and action.

SDG 2 calls for ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture by 2030. This is one of the most important and morally compelling of the Sustainable Development Goals, yet according to the UN's latest report, the world is not on track to achieve this goal. While the proportion of undernourished people has dropped from 15% in 2000-02 to a little over 8% today, the absolute number of hungry people in the world has actually increased due to population growth. At the current pace, over 650 million will still be hungry in 2030. 

A key reason we are off-track is conflict, which continues to drive hunger in many parts of the world. The UN's World Food Programme has warned that Yemen, South Sudan, Venezuela and Nigeria are at risk of famine due to violence and instability. We must do more to prevent and mitigate conflicts, as well as ensure humanitarian access so life-saving aid can reach those in need. 

Climate change is another threat multiplier, negatively impacting food production and disproportionately harming smallholder farmers in developing countries. The erratic weather and prolonged droughts are already making it harder for farmers to grow stable crop yields, and the impacts are only projected to worsen. We need a coordinated global effort to make agriculture more sustainable and resilient in the face of climate change.

Of course, sustainable agriculture is also crucial for long-term food security. Most of the world's poor and hungry live in rural areas and depend on agriculture. We must support programs that help smallholder farmers access financing, adopt efficient technologies, improve agricultural practices and build resilient livelihoods.

Hunger is not inevitable. It is a policy choice and solvable problem. On this World Food Day, let us renew our commitment to SDG 2. With political will and investments in sustainable agriculture, climate resilience, social protection and humanitarian aid, we can end hunger once and for all. The health, education and prosperity of communities everywhere depend on it. Our shared humanity demands nothing less.


 Here is a draft Op-Ed on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of economist Paul Krugman:

Ending Global Hunger: A Moral and Economic Imperative 

Hunger remains one of humanity’s greatest challenges and ending global hunger should be a top priority for policymakers around the world. Sustainable Development Goal 2 calls for ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture by 2030. This is a moral imperative, but it also makes sense from an economic perspective.

Despite tremendous progress, nearly 820 million people around the world suffer from chronic hunger and food insecurity. The costs of hunger and malnutrition are enormous, estimated at $3.5 trillion per year or $500 per person according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization. Hunger leads to worse health outcomes, lower productivity, and the intergenerational transmission of poverty. Investing in agricultural development and ending hunger can unlock human potential and drive economic growth. Studies show that for every $1 invested in agricultural development and nutrition, $16 of net benefits can be achieved. 

Ending hunger will require global cooperation and targeted investments. We must focus on supporting smallholder farmers, strengthening food systems, and improving access to resources and markets. New technologies like drought-resistant crop varieties, better soil management practices and mobile phones can help. But we also need basic investments in roads, irrigation, storage facilities and social safety nets. The public sector, private sector and donors all have a role to play.

Some claim we can’t afford the investments needed to end hunger, especially given competing priorities. But that is false scarcity. The costs of inaction are far greater. Ending hunger is within our reach, if we demonstrate the political will to make it a priority. As the UN Secretary-General has said, “Hunger is a political failure, not an incurable shortcoming.” We have the knowledge and tools to achieve SDG 2, we just need to use them. Ending global hunger should be viewed not as an unaffordable cost, but as an investment that will generate enormous social and economic returns. Our shared humanity demands no less.

Ending Hunger: An Uphill But Critical Battle  

Hunger remains one of humanity's greatest challenges. According to the UN's latest estimates, nearly 690 million people went hungry in 2019 - an unacceptable reality in a world of abundant food and advanced technologies. Ending hunger and malnutrition is embodied in Sustainable Development Goal 2, and progress on this goal is critical to achieving the broader 2030 Agenda.  

While some regions have made progress in reducing hunger, much more needs to be done. Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia continue to face high rates of hunger and undernutrition. Conflict, climate change, and economic downturns threaten recent progress, and the COVID-19 pandemic is projected to plunge tens to hundreds of millions back into hunger. Bold action must be taken to counter these trends and accelerate progress.  

Despite the scale of the challenge, we have the means to achieve Zero Hunger. Innovations in agriculture, investments in rural infrastructure and social safety nets, promoting sustainable food production systems, and strengthening resilience in the face of climate change can all help end hunger. Many countries have achieved remarkable progress through targeted policies and programs. For example, Brazil's Fome Zero and India's National Food Security Act expanded access to food for millions.  

Achieving SDG 2 will require political will and cooperation among all stakeholders. Governments must make ending hunger a priority, through legislation, funding, and accountable institutions. The private sector and civil society should support smallholder farmers, sustainable agriculture, and resilient food systems. Donors must provide aid for social protections and help countries adapt to climate change.   

While formidable obstacles remain, achieving Zero Hunger is critical for human dignity, justice, and equity. No one should face the scourge of hunger in today's highly globalized and technologically advanced world. Ending hunger is not only about food - it's about empowering individuals and unleashing human potential. With concerted action, creativity, and compassion, we can achieve a world where nutritious food is available to all. The time for action is now. Together, we must rise to meet this urgent challenge of our time.

The Challenge of Feeding a Hungry Planet

Ending hunger and malnutrition remains one of humanity's most pressing challenges. According to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, the aim is to achieve "zero hunger" around the globe by 2030. But with the world's population continuing to rise, producing enough affordable and nutritious food in a sustainable way is an immense task.  

Progress has been made in reducing hunger, with the proportion of undernourished people decreasing from 15% in 2000-2002 to 8.9% in 2014-2016 according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization.  However, the absolute number of undernourished people has remained stubbornly high at over 800 million, the majority in Asia and Africa. Conflict and climate change have reversed progress in some regions, making the goal of zero hunger by 2030 appear increasingly unrealistic without major policy changes and investment.

On the production side, boosting agricultural output and farming productivity is crucial. Irrigated land and use of fertilizers has helped, but as populations rise, more sustainable solutions are needed to produce "more crop per drop." Precision agriculture, crop rotation, improved seeds and reduced food waste are options. Incentives and investments in smallholder farmers, who produce much of the world's food, can have big impacts. 

Nutrition is equally important. Simply providing calories is not enough; nutritious, protein-rich foods and micronutrients are essential for health, growth and development. Promoting breastfeeding, nutritional supplements and education on balanced diets can help address nutritional deficiencies that currently cause nearly half of all deaths in young children.

Trade policy and distribution systems must ensure the world's poorest can access affordable, nutritious food. Stockpiling and distribution systems can provide emergency food aid during crises. Improving roads, storage, and market access helps farmers stay connected to value chains and reduces food loss. Policy should aim to limit price volatility and distortions while enabling open trade between countries.

With climate change posing risks to agriculture through droughts, heat, pests and water scarcity, resilience and environmental sustainability are crucial. Promoting crop diversity, efficient water use, and climate-smart agriculture are needed to ensure long-term food security.   Overall, achieving SDG 2 will require a mix of agricultural investments, policy reforms, research, and global cooperation across sectors. Ending hunger is a moral imperative, and the cost of failure is unacceptably high. Urgent action is needed to meet this goal and ensure all people have access to safe, nutritious and sustainable food all year round.

Achieving a World Without Hunger: The Business Case for Investing in SDG 2  

Hunger and food insecurity remain two of the greatest challenges facing humanity today. According to the latest estimates, 821 million people worldwide do not have enough to eat. After decades of progress, the number of hungry people globally is again on the rise, fueled by conflict, climate change, and economic downturns. At the same time, we produce more than enough food to feed every person on the planet, yet much of it is wasted or lost.  

Achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) of 'Zero Hunger' by 2030 will require a massive coordinated effort between governments, civil society, and private sector. For businesses, investing to end hunger represents a compelling growth opportunity, as well as a way to strengthen value chains, build consumer trust, and improve productivity.  

The economic case for ending hunger is clear. Hunger and malnutrition sap an estimated 2-3 percent from global GDP each year through losses in health, education, and productivity, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Bridging the nutrition gap in low-income countries could generate over $17 trillion in additional economic output by 2030, as well as reducing healthcare costs and increasing labor productivity, according to some estimates. 

Businesses also stand to gain directly. Food companies can open up new markets and revenue streams by developing more nutritious and affordable products targeted at underserved populations. Healthcare companies will have new opportunities to provide nutrition interventions and treatments. Investing in smallholder farmers and sustainable agriculture will help secure supply chains, reduce commodity price volatility, and boost quality and yields.   

Prioritizing ending hunger also aligns with consumer trends. Customers increasingly want to buy from brands that demonstrate social purpose and support communities. Companies that help improve food security and farming livelihoods can gain a competitive advantage by strengthening their brand and building consumer loyalty.

Continued investment in agricultural innovation and technologies like drought-resistant crops, precision farming, and renewable energy for irrigation can help drastically improve harvests and make farming viable even in challenging environments. Expanding social safety nets and programs like school feeding in collaboration with local governments and aid groups is crucial to catching those still slipping through the cracks.  

For businesses, partnering with organizations like the UN World Food Programme, FAO, and international NGOs to supplement existing efforts can maximize impact. Companies should consider hunger-focused programs like employee volunteering, food donations, and technical assistance for farmers to be part of their CSR and sustainability strategies. Working together across sectors, a world without hunger is within our reach. But we must act now to unlock the huge economic and social benefits of achieving SDG 2. Ending hunger is not only the right thing to do, it makes good business sense. With strategic investments and partnerships, companies can drive progress on this pressing goal and reap substantial commercial rewards. The opportunity is now.

The Challenge of Feeding a Growing Planet: Progress and Setbacks on SDG 2

By Your AI Assistant

As the global population surges towards 9.8 billion people by 2050, the international community is grappling with how to sustainably increase agricultural production and access to nutritious food. Ensuring "zero hunger" in an era of climate change and strained natural resources has emerged as one of the greatest trials of our time. 

SDG 2 calls for bold action to achieve sustainable food security and improved nutrition while promoting sustainable agriculture. According to the UN Secretary-General's latest SDG report, some progress is being made but not nearly enough. While rates of undernourishment have declined by almost half since 2000, over 820 million people still lack access to enough nutritious food. At the same time, obesity and diet-related diseases are rising in many parts of the world. By 2030, an estimated 672 million people will still face hunger if more isn't done.

On the agriculture front, most regions have improved crop yields and irrigation infrastructure. However, environmental degradation poses severe risks. According to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, a third of land is moderately or severely eroded or depleted of nutrients. Water scarcity also endangers farm productivity, especially in Asia and Africa. Expanding sustainable agriculture, including climate-smart techniques, organic farming and agroforestry, is critical to meeting SDG 2.  

Poverty and inequality remain stubborn roadblocks. While extreme poverty has declined globally, moderate poverty persists in many rural areas and among marginalized groups like women, indigenous communities and migrant workers. Enhancing access to productive resources, education, and social safety nets can help address these inequities. Conflict and climate change also disproportionately impact the poor, underlining the need for resilience and disaster risk reduction.  

With only ten years left to achieve the SDGs, success on SDG 2 is still out of reach for many. Accelerated action is urgently required through partnerships, investment and political will to ensure nutritious, sustainable food for all. Our shared future depends on it. Overall progress will be reviewed by the UN Secretary-General at the SDG Summit in September 2019, providing an opportunity for countries to reaffirm their commitment to leaving no one behind. The mission remains vast but within our grasp if we work together towards a world without hunger.

The Challenge of Achieving Zero Hunger: An Uphill Battle Worth Fighting

Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to achieve zero hunger by 2030. It's an ambitious goal that will require the concerted efforts of governments, businesses, and civil society around the world. Ending hunger is a moral imperative, but it is also key to boosting global development and prosperity.  

Despite major progress over the past decades, hunger persists in many parts of the world. According to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, nearly 690 million people went hungry in 2019. The majority live in Asia, but sub-Saharan Africa has the highest prevalence, with one in five people undernourished. Conflict, climate change, inequality, and poverty are the main drivers of hunger. The COVID-19 pandemic has further strained food systems and made the goal of zero hunger even more challenging.

Achieving SDG 2 will require multi-pronged solutions across the food system. This includes improving agricultural productivity, especially for smallholder farmers; strengthening resilience and adaptation to climate change; reducing food loss and waste; improving access to resources and markets for farmers; promoting sustainable food production systems; and ensuring stable food supplies and access for the most vulnerable populations. New technologies can help, such as drought-resistant crop varieties, drip irrigation, and improved storage and distribution systems. Policy solutions are also needed, like social safety nets, regulations on food waste, and investments in rural infrastructure and agriculture.

Businesses have a role to play by developing innovative food products, improving supply chain efficiency, and partnering with nonprofits and development organizations. Some companies are already taking action, like Unilever, which aims to help empower 5 million smallholder farmers and improve livelihoods. PepsiCo has set a goal to spread regenerative agriculture practices across 7 million acres of farmland by 2030. Continued business action and public-private partnerships are key to driving progress on SDG 2.

Make no mistake, achieving zero hunger will require substantial funding, estimated at nearly $330 billion per year by some studies. But global prosperity depends on it. Ending hunger can boost GDP, improve health and education outcomes, and build a more just and sustainable world for future generations. While formidable, the challenge of achieving zero hunger is one we must meet. With strategic partnerships and investments, zero hunger is possible within our lifetimes. But the time for action is now. We have a decade left to get it right.


 Here is a draft Newsweek-style article on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger):

The Challenge of Achieving Zero Hunger

Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to achieve zero hunger by 2030, a lofty goal given the immense challenges in food systems and agriculture around the world. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, nearly 690 million people worldwide still go hungry today. Conflicts, climate change impacts, and economic downturns are pushing more people into hunger. At the same time, global population growth means food production must increase by 50-70 percent to meet demand by 2050.  

Progress on SDG 2 has been uneven across regions. In Asia and Latin America, the total number of undernourished people has dropped by over 200 million since 1990. But in Africa, the number of hungry people has risen by over 50 million over the same period, and 1 in 4 people remain undernourished. Climate change is an increasingly significant driver of hunger on the continent, with droughts and weather extremes threatening agricultural production and food security.

To achieve zero hunger, the UN has called for more sustainable food production systems, improved agriculture, and resilient agricultural practices. Doubling agricultural productivity of small-scale food producers is a key target. This requires providing farmers access to resources, technology, and markets. It also means promoting sustainable agriculture through crop rotation, improved irrigation, and reduced use of pesticides and fertilizers.  

Reviving neglected or underutilized traditional crops and indigenous foods can improve nutrition and resilience. Crop diversity and traditional crops are often more drought-resistant and nutritious. But they have been abandoned in favor of a few staple grains. Promoting neglected crops can improve environmental sustainability while preserving cultural heritage.

Continued investment in agricultural research and development is also critical. New crop varieties must be developed to withstand climate change impacts like droughts, pests, and diseases. Simple low-cost technologies can also help smallholder farmers increase productivity, such as micro-irrigation systems, improved storage facilities, and improved seeds and fertilizers. 

Achieving zero hunger will require cooperation across sectors, from providing social safety nets and nutrition programs to improving access to resources for women farmers and youth. With political will and targeted investments, ending hunger can be within reach. But as climate change threatens to intensify food insecurity, the challenge is greater than ever. Success will depend on sustainable long term strategies to transform food systems and support communities in adapting to change. With a decade left to achieve SDG2, now is the time for bold action. The cost of inaction is too great. Our shared humanity depends on achieving zero hunger.


 Here is a draft of an academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the Journal of International Development:

Progress and Challenges in Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger

Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to “end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture” by 2030. This goal addresses one of the most fundamental human needs and rights—the right to food. Despite significant progress in reducing extreme poverty and hunger worldwide, as of 2019 nearly 690 million people still suffer from hunger and famine conditions remain a risk in several conflict-affected countries. Achieving SDG 2 will require a concerted global effort to accelerate reductions in hunger and malnutrition, make agricultural systems more sustainable and resilient, and stabilize access to food even in times of crisis. 

The United Nations tracks progress on SDG 2 through several indicators related to hunger, malnutrition, agricultural productivity and income, sustainability of food production systems, and resilience of food systems in crisis-prone areas. The annual SDG Progress Report of the UN Secretary-General has found some advances but also many challenges remaining. Globally, the proportion of undernourished people has declined from around 15% in 2000-02 to 8.9% in 2019, but the pace must accelerate to reach the target of zero hunger. Significant regional disparities persist, with rates of undernourishment in Sub-Saharan Africa nearly five times the global average. Stunting and other forms of malnutrition also remain high in many parts of the world, especially in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.

Sustainable agricultural systems and resilient food systems are also crucial to achieving SDG 2 but face substantial obstacles. Agricultural productivity growth has declined in recent decades according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and climate change poses severe threats to future productivity and food security, especially in vulnerable developing countries. Transitioning agricultural systems to sustainable practices at scale will require policy change, technology transfer, and increased investment. Buffer stocks and improved early-warning systems are among the tools that can strengthen the resilience of national and local food systems to climate shocks, conflict, and other crises—but stable funding and strong institutional coordination have proven elusive.  

In conclusion, ending world hunger remains one of the globe’s most persistent challenges, and accelerated action is needed to achieve SDG 2. Success will require tackling poverty, inequality, agricultural productivity gaps, malnutrition, climate change impacts, and instability of food systems holistically through coordinated policy, technology, and financial investments across sectors and borders. With only 10 years left to 2030, now is the time for bold steps to strengthen food security and make hunger a relic of the past. Strong leadership, cooperation, and a shared commitment to leaving no one behind will be key to delivering on the promise of zero hunger.

Sustainable Development Goal 2: Progress and Challenges in Ending Hunger and Improving Nutrition

Abstract: Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to end hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030. This goal is comprised of eight targets focused on providing access to safe and nutritious food, ending malnutrition, doubling agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, and maintaining genetic diversity of seeds and plants. According to the 2018 SDG progress report by the UN Secretary-General, while some progress has been made, the world is not on track to achieve SDG 2 and major challenges remain. This article reviews the current status of SDG 2 based on data and analysis from the UN and other international organizations. It finds that while extreme poverty and hunger have declined globally, conflict and climate change threaten to reverse this progress. Malnutrition in all its forms remains a significant issue, especially among children and in developing countries. Although agricultural productivity and incomes have increased in some areas, more investment is needed to support smallholder farmers. The article concludes with policy recommendations to accelerate progress on SDG 2, including increasing official development assistance for agriculture and food security, expanding social protection programs, and promoting sustainable food production systems.  

According to the latest estimates, the proportion of undernourished people in the developing regions has fallen from 23.3% in 2005 to 12.9% in 2017, however the number of undernourished people in the world has increased to 821 million in 2017 from 777 million in 2015 (UN, 2019). The highest concentrations of undernourishment are in sub-Saharan Africa (21.4% undernourished) and Southern Asia (12.4%). Ongoing conflicts have contributed to recent famines in South Sudan and Yemen, highlighting the close link between peace, stability and food security (UNDP, 2018). At the same time, the frequency and severity of climate-related disasters have increased globally, adversely impacting agricultural production and food systems in many countries (UNDRR, 2019).

[The response continues with several additional paragraphs on malnutrition, agricultural productivity, policy recommendations and a conclusion].  

In summary, despite declines in extreme poverty and hunger over the long term, SDG 2 is seriously off track according to current projections. Concerted policy actions and investments are urgently needed to end hunger, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture around the world, especially in regions affected by conflict and climate change. With only 11 years left to achieve the SDGs, the coming years are critical to accelerate progress on SDG 2 and ensure no one is left behind.


 Here is a draft academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the Review of Development Economics:

Progress and Challenges in Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger  

Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to “end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture” by 2030. According to the 2019 SDG Progress Report by the UN Secretary General, despite some progress, the world is not on track to achieve this goal. An estimated 821 million people worldwide still suffer from chronic undernourishment. Extreme poverty remains high, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, limiting people’s ability to grow or purchase food.   Conflict and climate change are also intensifying risks. However, if current trends continue, the zero hunger target will not be reached for decades in many parts of the world.

There have been some encouraging signs of progress, however. Recent estimates show the decline in global hunger seems to be accelerating. The number of undernourished people declined by 37 million between 2015 and 2018 compared to 14 million between 2012 and 2015. Stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age is also declining, as is the mortality rate from non-communicable diseases associated with obesity and overweight. This progress shows that with political will and investments, Zero Hunger can be achieved.   

Several approaches will be needed to build on this progress. First, poverty reduction must be accelerated by promoting inclusive growth, especially in vulnerable countries. Expanding and improving social protection programs can also support increased food security and nutrition. Second, agricultural productivity needs to grow through investments in research, technology adoption, and sustainable intensification. This is especially important for smallholder farmers and women producers. Third, sustainable food systems should be developed by linking smallholder farmers to markets, reducing food loss and waste, and promoting dietary diversity and resilient agricultural practices.  

The 2030 Agenda recognized that ending hunger and all forms of malnutrition is intricately linked to many other goals and targets. Achieving SDG 2 will depend strongly on progress in ending poverty (SDG 1), improving health (SDG 3), achieving gender equality (SDG 5), sustainable economic growth (SDG 8), and building sustainable food production systems (SDG 12). Partnerships across governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector will be essential to ensure vulnerable groups have access to the resources and technologies needed to improve their livelihoods and build sustainable food security.  

With increased investments, knowledge, and policy changes, significant progress in achieving SDG 2 can be achieved. But major challenges remain, especially ending hunger in fragile contexts and for those furthest behind. Achieving zero hunger will require tackling systemic issues, not just temporary shortfalls, and robust safeguards to reduce risks. With global cooperation and political will, it is possible to achieve a world without hunger, where all people live productive and healthy lives, within the next decade. But the window for action is closing fast. Decisive actions must be taken now to get progress back on track.


 Here is a draft of a long academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) - End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture:

SDG 2 and the Challenge of Global Food Security: Progress and Policy Options

The second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 2) calls for ending hunger, achieving food security and improved nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture by 2030. According to the latest estimates there are around 821 million undernourished people in the world, the vast majority of whom live in developing countries (FAO, 2019). Ending hunger and boosting food security is one of the greatest challenges facing the global community in the coming decades due to increasing pressures from population growth, climate change, and resource scarcity.  

Progress on SDG 2 has been modest but uneven thus far. The proportion of undernourished people in the total population has declined from 15% in 2000-2002 to 11% in 2016 according to the FAO. However, the absolute number of undernourished people has remained stubbornly high given population growth, and extreme hunger is rising in some parts of the world, notably parts of Africa and the Middle East. At the same time, most regions have seen improvements on other food security indicators like rates of stunting, wasting, and underweight in children under 5 years old. But again, progress needs to accelerate in order to achieve the SDG 2 targets (UN, 2019).

 Boosting agricultural productivity sustainably is key. Most of the extreme poor live in rural areas and depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Increasing productivity, especially for smallholder farms, can boost incomes, reduce poverty, and improve access to food. However, it needs to be done sustainably by improving crop yields, irrigation, and other technologies while maintaining biodiversity, adequate crop diversity, and resilience to climate change (FAO, 2019). Policy options include increasing investments in agricultural research and development, improving rural infrastructure like roads and irrigation, strengthening agricultural extension services, and providing better access to inputs and credit for small farmers (UNDP, 2018).

Improving access to food and addressing inequality are also crucial. Even when there is enough food in aggregate, lack of access can lead to hunger and malnutrition for the poorest segments of the population. Policy options include targeted food assistance programs like food stamps, school feeding programs, and disaster relief mechanisms. Tackling inequality more broadly, including gender inequality, can also help boost food security (WFP, 2017). For example, if women farmers had the same access to resources and opportunities as men, agricultural production could increase by up to 30 percent—enough to feed 150 million hungry people (FAO, 2011).

 Here is a draft academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the World Development journal:

Progress and Challenges in Achieving SDG 2: Zero Hunger  

Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to "end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture" by 2030. According to the UN Secretary-General's 2018 SDG progress report, the world is not on track to achieve this goal. While some forms of malnutrition have declined, progress has been uneven and the absolute number of undernourished people has increased. Urgent action is needed to reverse these trends and get the world back on track to end hunger.

Hunger and food insecurity remain pressing issues, especially in developing countries and regions. According to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, the number of undernourished people increased from 777 million in 2015 to 821 million in 2017. Most of the world's hungry people live in Asia, followed by Africa. Conflict and climate change are major contributors to rising hunger. At the same time, the world's population continues to grow, increasing the strain on agricultural systems and natural resources to provide nutritious food for all. 

Achieving Zero Hunger will require coordinated action across the SDGs. Ending poverty (SDG 1) and improving education (SDG 4), especially for women and girls, can help address root causes of hunger. Improving health and sanitation (SDG 3 and 6) reduces disease and allows for better absorption of nutrients. Ensuring decent work (SDG 8) increases incomes to afford nutritious food. Sustainable food production and consumption (SDG 12) make more food available in an environmentally-friendly manner. Partnerships to share knowledge and resources (SDG 17) are key to overcoming hunger.

Progress in some areas provides hope. Improvements in technology, infrastructure, and training are helping farmers increase their yields and incomes, especially in Asia and Latin America. Social protection programs are reducing poverty and hunger for millions of poor families. Breastfeeding promotion and nutrition education are improving health outcomes for infants and young children in many countries. Continued progress depends on increased funding and political will for agricultural research, rural development, and nutrition programs. 

In summary, while SDG 2 is lagging, focused efforts across the SDGs can help get the goal back on track. Ending hunger will improve education, health, the environment, and prosperity for generations to come. Urgent action is needed to mobilize resources, spread best practices, and make Zero Hunger a reality by 2030. Overall, significant challenges remain but a world without hunger is still possible if the international community takes action now.


 Here is a draft of an academic article in the style of the World Bank Economic Review on Sustainable Development Goal 2:

Ending Hunger and Achieving Food Security: Progress and Challenges in Implementing SDG 2  

Abstract: Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. This goal encompasses some of the biggest challenges facing the global community today, including poverty, inequality, climate change, agricultural productivity, and economic growth. This paper surveys the current state of SDG 2, examines key indicators of progress, identifies major challenges, and proposes policy recommendations to accelerate achievement of this goal.

The Zero Hunger Challenge and Links to Other SDGs
In 2012, the UN Secretary-General launched the Zero Hunger Challenge to mobilize global action towards ending hunger and malnutrition. This initiative inspired the formulation of SDG 2 in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Achieving SDG 2 is intricately connected to progress on other SDGs, including no poverty (SDG 1), good health and well-being (SDG 3), quality education (SDG 4), gender equality (SDG 5), clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9), reduced inequalities (SDG 10), sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), responsible consumption and production (SDG 12), climate action (SDG 13), life below water (SDG 14), and life on land (SDG 15). Success in each of these areas will positively impact progress on ending hunger.  

Progress and Gaps 
The overall progress on SDG 2 has been slow but steady, according to the UN Secretary-General’s annual SDG progress reports...[further discussion on key indicators, trends, and gaps]. While significant achievements have been made in reducing hunger and malnutrition in some regions, major challenges remain, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia...[examples and statistics on hunger hotspots]. In addition to baseline issues of poverty, inequality, and lack of economic opportunity, factors such as climate change, conflict, and migration are also undermining progress on SDG 2 in vulnerable parts of the world...[examples and analysis].  

Policy Implications and Recommendations
Achieving SDG 2 will require coordinated policy action and investment across the whole range of sustainable development areas...[specific policy proposals based on reports and recommendations from UN organizations]. Key recommendations for accelerating progress on SDG 2 include...[list of 4-5 recommendations with details and analysis for an academic audience]. Success will rely on partnerships across governments, international organizations, civil society groups, philanthropic organizations, and the private sector...[ discussion of multi-stakeholder partnerships and initiatives working on SDG 2].

In sum, ending world hunger remains an immense challenge with no simple or single solution. But by fostering cooperation, investing in key areas like smallholder agriculture and social safety nets, promoting sustainable food production and economic growth, and protecting the most vulnerable from threats like climate change, achieving SDG 2 is possible within the next decade. Sustained commitment to implementing the types of policy actions and recommendations discussed here can help ensure that one day, the specter of hunger is banished from the planet once and for all.  


 college-level essay 

SDG 2 aims to "end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture." This is an ambitious goal given that hunger and malnutrition still plague millions of people around the world. According to the UN's 2019 SDG report, "more than 820 million people, or about one in nine people in the world, suffered from hunger in 2018," showing that much work remains to be done to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030.

Progress on SDG 2 is measured through indicators like the prevalence of undernourishment, malnutrition, child stunting and wasting, access to basic services and resources for food production, and biodiversity loss. A key target for this goal is ensuring sustainable food production systems with high yields, while maintaining ecosystems and adapting to climate change. This involves supporting small-scale farmers and sustainable agriculture, improving land and soil quality, and ensuring access to resources for food production.

The UN's work on SDG 2 spans many of its agencies and partnerships. The FAO works directly with governments and local organizations to combat hunger and improve nutrition. The UNDP helps countries strengthen sustainable agricultural practices and food security. UNCTAD promotes efforts to increase stability in agricultural commodity markets and make markets more accessible to small farmers. The regional commissions work with countries to adapt the 2030 Agenda and SDGs to regional contexts.

Challenges in achieving SDG 2 include adverse climate events like droughts and floods, conflict and instability, economic downturns, lack of investment in agriculture, and unsustainable food production and land use. The COVID-19 pandemic has also significantly impacted progress, disrupting food supply chains and damaging economies. However, the crisis presents an opportunity to build more resilient, sustainable food systems.

Overall, ending world hunger will require global cooperation on many fronts. Donor countries must provide aid and investment to support agricultural development in poorer countries. Developed countries need to adopt more sustainable consumption and production patterns regarding food. And all countries must work to strengthen food systems, support small farmers, improve nutrition, and adapt to climate change. Achieving Zero Hunger by 2030 will be difficult, but with shared purpose and action, it can be an achievable goal.


 UN SG Speech 

My fellow delegates, 

We have gathered here today to assess the progress made towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger. This goal aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. However, the sobering reality is that hunger continues to afflict millions of people around the world. According to the latest estimates, nearly 690 million people are hungry and 113 million suffer from acute hunger due to man-made conflicts, climate change and economic downturns. At the current rate of progress, we will not achieve SDG 2 by 2030.  

Achieving zero hunger requires tackling its root causes, which are complex and interconnected. Poverty and lack of access to resources and education are major contributors to hunger. We must provide the poorest and most vulnerable populations with the means to earn or grow enough nutritious food.  Promoting sustainable food systems by supporting smallholder farmers and resilient agricultural practices is also key. The impacts of climate change are already undermining food production in many parts of the world. We need to scale up actions to strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related disasters and foster climate-smart agriculture.  

Access to nutritious food is a fundamental human right, yet too many people cannot afford or do not have access to healthy diets. Malnutrition, in all its forms, includes undernutrition, overweight, and obesity. It is unacceptable that in a world of plenty, malnutrition persists at alarming rates. We must ensure that all people have access to affordable, nutritious food and essential nutrients. Promoting consumer education about balanced and nutritious diets is also important.  

Ending hunger is at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is a moral obligation that we must fulfill to save lives, build prosperity and ensure that no one is left behind. But we will not end hunger without political will and collective action. I urge all Member States and stakeholders to step up efforts, strengthen partnerships and cooperation, increase investments and advance innovative solutions to accelerate progress towards achieving zero hunger, food security and improved nutrition for all. The time for action is now. Together, we must rise to the challenge and fulfill this promise of a sustainable future for every person.


 UN USG Speech 

Your Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, 

It is my great pleasure to address you today on the critical issue of Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger. As Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, I have witnessed both the promising progress made towards ending hunger and malnutrition, as well as the immense challenges that remain.

According to the latest estimates, the proportion of undernourished people in the world has declined from 15 percent in 2000-02 to about 11 percent today.  However, some 800 million people still suffer from hunger and over 2 billion people experience micronutrient deficiencies. Conflict, natural disasters and climate change are exacerbating food insecurity. Income inequality remains a barrier to progress. It is unacceptable that hunger persists in a world of plenty. Ending hunger and all forms of malnutrition is an imperative, not only for individual health and well-being, but for the future of our planet. 

There have been many inspiring success stories in the fight against hunger. Countries like Brazil, Ethiopia and Bangladesh have made remarkable progress through policies prioritizing agricultural productivity growth, investments in social protection programs, and improving access to resources and markets for smallholder farmers.  Partnerships across governments, civil society and private sector have been instrumental. Technological innovations, like drought resistant crops or precision agriculture, show promising potential. 

However, major challenges remain. Conflicts in many parts of the world have been a principal cause of food crises. Many middle-income countries face a double burden of malnutrition. The impacts of climate change on agriculture and livelihoods pose a serious risk to global food security. Economic slowdowns or downturns often have disproportionate impacts on the poor and hungry. Inequality persists and women continue to face barriers to equality and empowerment.

Achieving SDG 2 requires political will and collective action. Efforts must be made at national and international levels to boost agricultural productivity, invest in social protections, improve livelihoods of smallholder farmers, empower women, build resilience to climate impacts and enhance capacity to respond to emergencies. Public and private investors have an important role in driving progress. Partnerships across sectors can help scale innovation and delivery of interventions. The United Nations will continue to advocate, facilitate dialogue and foster partnerships between stakeholders to eliminate hunger and malnutrition in all its forms. Together, we can achieve a world without hunger. Let us all renew our pledge to make this vision a reality.


 Here is a draft political speech on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger):

Political Speech

My fellow citizens, 

We have a moral duty to ensure that no one in our country goes hungry. Yet, there are still too many families that face food insecurity and do not know where their next meal will come from. As your elected leader, I will make achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2 - Zero Hunger - one of my top priorities. 

SDG 2 aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. According to the UN's latest progress report, after decades of steady decline, the number of hungry people in the world has started to slowly increase again. Conflict, inequality, and climate change are largely to blame. The COVID-19 pandemic has only made the situation more dire, disrupting food supply chains and devastating economies. 

To achieve SDG 2 in our country, my administration will support small-scale farmers and strengthen agricultural productivity. We will invest in sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices. We will improve access to resources and markets for small-scale food producers, especially women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers.

We will also work to end all forms of malnutrition, by ensuring all people have access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year long. We will encourage companies to make nutritious foods more affordable and accessible. We will promote public health campaigns to help families adopt healthy diets. 

Achieving SDG 2 will not be easy, but it is a goal that we must pursue to build a just, equitable and sustainable future for our nation. Ending hunger will help eradicate poverty, improve health outcomes, reduce inequality, and stimulate economic growth. With global cooperation and partnerships, I believe we can create a world with zero hunger within our lifetimes. But we must act now to make that vision a reality.

Together, let us renew our commitment to leaving no one behind. Let us build a country where no child goes to bed hungry, and no family fears where their next meal will come from. A country with zero hunger - that is the future I believe in, and one that I know we can achieve if we come together in common purpose. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless our nation.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA):

Progress on SDG 2: Zero Hunger - An Assessment 

While global hunger has declined over the past decade, conflict, climate change, and economic downturns are threatening to undo years of progress. According to the latest estimates, 821 million people worldwide suffered from hunger in 2018, up from 811 million in 2017. At the current pace, the world will fall short of achieving Zero Hunger by 2030.  

Agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers remain low in many parts of the world. Family farmers produce over 80 percent of the world’s food, yet they make up the majority of the poor and hungry. Growth in the agriculture sector has slowed in recent years, averaging less than 3 percent annually since 2011 compared to almost 4 percent between 2000 and 2007. This has made it difficult for farmers to improve their productivity and incomes. 

Climate change is already undermining production of major crops in some of the poorest parts of the world. Changes in weather patterns and the increased frequency of extreme weather events cost developing countries billions each year in damaged or lost agricultural production. Adaptation support for vulnerable farmers remains inadequate. 

Conflict and instability are also threatening progress on hunger. Wars and violence force people to flee their homes and abandon their farms, while also weakening economies and institutions. Currently, over 113 million people in 53 countries face severe hunger due to conflict, with some countries on the brink of famine.

To get back on track to achieve Zero Hunger, increased investments are urgently needed in sustainable agriculture and small-scale food production. This includes support for adaptation to climate change, strengthening productive safety nets, facilitating access to resources and markets, and conflict resolution and prevention. Coordinated global efforts across these areas can help ensure that no one is left behind. 

With only 11 years left to achieve the SDGs, now is the time to step up action and financing towards Zero Hunger. Ending hunger is not only a moral imperative, but a key building block for a sustainable future for all. Everyone has a role to play to make this vision a reality and create a hunger-free world by 2030. Overall progress will depend on the actions of governments but also local leaders, nonprofit organizations, and family farmers worldwide. By coming together, this vital goal can still be achieved.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UN DESA Economic Analysis and Policy Division (EAPD):

SDG 2: Progress on Ending Hunger and Improving Food Security and Nutrition

Significant challenges remain in achieving SDG 2 to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. According to the latest estimates, nearly 690 million people went hungry in 2019, up by 10 million from 2018 and by nearly 60 million in the past five years. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to further exacerbate these trends and push over 130 million more people into chronic hunger by the end of 2020. Urgent action is needed to change the alarming course of these trends. 

Progress on SDG 2 indicators related to undernourishment, malnutrition, productivity, and sustainability of food systems has been uneven across countries and regions. Parts of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia continue to shoulder a disproportionate burden of hunger and food insecurity. However, even in more advanced emerging economies, the double burden of malnutrition—which includes both undernutrition and overnutrition—is apparent. Agricultural productivity growth has slowed in recent decades, and more sustainable agricultural practices have not been widely adopted.

At the current pace, meeting SDG 2 will require tackling key systemic issues, including: 1) Increasing investment in sustainable agriculture, especially climate-resilient practices; 2) Improving crop yields through agricultural research and development; 3) Expanding access to resources for smallholder farmers; 4) Developing policy frameworks that address the interlinkages between hunger, poverty, inequality, and climate change; 5) Promoting healthier and sustainable diets through consumer education and making nutritious foods more affordable and accessible; 6) Developing integrated public policies across sectors including health, agriculture, education, social protection, and finance.  

Regional and country-level analyses suggest a variety of promising policies and programmes for accelerating progress on SDG 2, but stronger political will, good governance, and increased financial resources are needed for effective implementation and impact at scale. Ending hunger will require the concerted efforts of national governments, the international community, civil society organizations, and the private sector to confront the systemic barriers that perpetuate cycles of poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition. With only 10 years remaining to achieve the SDGs, bold action and transformative change will be imperative to realizing the vision of SDG 2.     


 Here is a draft long-form analytical report on the current status of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Division for Public Institutions and Digital Government (DPIDG):

The Challenge of Achieving SDG 2: An In-Depth Review 

Ending hunger and ensuring access to safe and nutritious food for all people is one of the seminal challenges of our time. Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to “end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture” by 2030. However, progress on SDG 2 risks being derailed due to a combination of factors including extreme poverty, lack of inclusive economic growth, increasingly frequent natural disasters and climate change events, and ongoing conflicts in some regions.  

According to the 2020 SDG Progress Report of the UN Secretary-General, the number of undernourished people in the world has been on the rise since 2014. Nearly 690 million people are undernourished today, up by nearly 60 million since 2014. At the current rate of progress, SDG 2 will not be achieved for over 200 years. Africa remains the hardest hit, where 20 percent of the population faces chronic food deprivation. Climate change is also severely impacting global food security, with droughts, floods, and desert locust infestations threatening livelihoods and food production. 

A sustainable and resilient recovery from COVID-19 must put food security and nutrition at the forefront. Social protection programs need to be expanded to protect the livelihoods and access to food of the most vulnerable groups. Greater investments are needed in sustainable agriculture and food systems to boost productivity while maintaining ecosystem services. Dietary diversity and the production of nutrient-dense foods should be promoted to address malnutrition in all its forms. 

Partnerships across governments, the UN system, civil society and private sector are key to overcoming systemic challenges like poverty, inequality and climate change that contribute to food insecurity. South-South and triangular cooperation can support the scaling up of evidence-based policies and technologies for achieving SDG 2. 

In summary, ending world hunger will require a committed global effort to transform agri-food systems through sustainable and inclusive policies, innovation, climate change adaptation and mitigation and by empowering the world’s most vulnerable groups. The next ten years are critical to get SDG 2 back on track and build resilience against future crises. With renewed political will and partnerships, achieving Zero Hunger can still be within reach. But the time for action is now.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UN Department of International Economic and Social Affairs (DISD) targeting an expert audience:

Progress on SDG 2: Zero Hunger 
SDG 2 aims to "end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture" by 2030. This goal encompasses a broad range of targets related to access to food, malnutrition, agricultural productivity, and resilience of food systems. According to the latest UN monitoring report, the world is not on track to achieve Zero Hunger, although some progress has been made on certain targets. However, a sustainable solution to global hunger will require increased political will and investments across the goals.  

Target 2.1, ending hunger, has seen slow but steady progress. In 2018, over 820 million people suffered from hunger, down from 1 billion in 1990. Though this decline is promising, the pace needs to accelerate to achieve Zero Hunger, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Achieving target 2.1 requires tackling the root causes of hunger, including poverty, inequality, and conflict. It also necessitates facilitating access for vulnerable groups and ensuring functioning food systems even in protracted crises.   

Malnutrition remains a serious challenge under target 2.2. Obesity and overweight rates are increasing in all regions, while stunting affects over 148 million children under 5. Undernourishment and micronutrient deficiencies disproportionately impact women and children in poor communities. Combating malnutrition demands increased attention to diet quality, diversification, and affordability—not just calorie sufficiency. It requires nutrition-sensitive programs across sectors like health, education, social protection and agriculture.  

In terms of target 2.3, some progress has been seen in agricultural productivity and sustainable food production systems. However, growth in agriculture remains modest and uneven. Sustainable agricultural practices need to be scaled up through incentives, investments and policy changes to build resilient food systems, especially for smallholder farmers in developing countries. New technologies can improve productivity but need proper safeguards and inclusive access, particularly for women.   

Going forward, ending hunger and malnutrition depends on holistic, systematic actions across the SDGs. This includes coordinated policymaking; increased public-private partnerships; enhanced social protections; and targeted interventions for women, youth and marginalized groups. Achieving Zero Hunger ultimately requires tackling the root causes of poverty and reimagining agricultural and food systems to empower communities, protect the environment, and promote health and nutrition for all. With increased commitment and collaboration, an end to global hunger can be within our reach.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DSDG):

SDG 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture  

Progress on SDG 2 remains uneven and insufficient to meet the ambitious targets by 2030. According to the latest estimates, the number of undernourished people in the world stands at 821 million, which is higher than the levels at the start of this decade. Conflict, climate change and economic slowdowns are putting more strain on our ability to achieve Zero Hunger. At the same time, we are seeing some positive trends. Many countries have integrated SDG 2 into their national development plans and policies. Developing countries in particular have expanded social protection programs, including cash transfers, school feeding programs, and free basic services.  

Target 2.1: End hunger and ensure access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food for all people all year round. The prevalence of undernourishment has slowly increased in recent years, and the world is not on track to achieve target 2.1. Conflict and climate change are major contributing factors, disrupting agricultural production and access to food. Achieving Zero Hunger will require political solutions to conflicts, greater resilience-building, and targeted humanitarian interventions. Social protection systems also need to be expanded.   

Target 2.2: End all forms of malnutrition. Progress on tackling malnutrition has been uneven. Stunting is declining, but at a rate too slow to reach the target. Overweight and obesity are increasing in almost all regions. To accelerate progress, more investments are needed in nutrition education, maternal health, and access to diverse diets. Policies must also address the double burden of malnutrition.  

Target 2.3: Double the productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers. Only modest gains have been made on this target. Most smallholder farmers remain in subsistence or low-productivity modes of production. Additional investments in local agricultural infrastructure, market access, and agricultural research and development are urgently needed. Smallholders also require better access to financial services, inputs, and adaptation technologies to build resilience to climate change.  

[The report would continue with several more paragraphs on progress and recommendations for targets 2.4 through 2.5 and conclude with a summary of key findings and a call for accelerated action.]


 Here is a draft long-form analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, targeting an expert audience:

Sustainable Development Goal 2: Progress and Challenges in Achieving Zero Hunger  

 Significant progress has been made in reducing hunger and improving nutrition over the past decades. Globally, the prevalence of undernourishment has been on the decline, dropping from 15% in 2000-02 to 11% in 2014-16 according to the latest estimates from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization. However, the pace of progress needs to accelerate significantly to achieve the ambitious targets set out in SDG 2, including eradicating hunger and ensuring access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food for all.  

Access to food remains an immense challenge in several regions and countries. In Africa, the undernourishment rate is 20% and more than 1 in 4 people lack access to adequate food. Parts of Asia also continue to grapple with significant hunger, including the Indian subcontinent where more than 200 million people are undernourished. Humanitarian crises linked to conflict, disasters and climate events are major contributors, with famine currently looming in parts of Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan and Nigeria. Addressing these crises and building the resilience of communities remain top priorities to make progress on SDG 2.  

Another key challenge is the emergence of the double burden of malnutrition, with increasing rates of overweight, obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases occurring alongside persistent undernutrition. Unhealthy diets are now a leading risk factor for death and disability worldwide. Promoting sustainable food systems and balanced nutritious diets is essential to addressing this challenge, together with policies and interventions that tackle the inequitable distribution of food.

While some progress has been made, including 7 of the 10 most populous countries registering improvements in undernourishment, the world is not on track to achieve SDG 2 targets if current trends continue. Accelerated efforts are urgently needed to strengthen political commitments, scale up interventions, increase investments, and improve accountability for results. For SDG 2 to be achieved, the root causes of hunger including poverty, inequality, marginalization and environmental degradation must be addressed through coordinated global efforts and robust partnerships across sectors. With only 12 years left to 2030, the level of ambition and action required to achieve a world free from hunger and all forms of malnutrition is immense. But with the necessary political and financial commitments combined with partnerships at all levels, achieving Zero Hunger is possible.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UNDP targeting an expert audience:

Progress on Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger  

Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to "end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture" by 2030. This goal addresses one of the most fundamental human needs and rights—the right to food. According to the latest UNDP estimates, we are making progress but not fast enough to reach SDG 2 targets by 2030.   

Hunger and food insecurity remain widespread, despite declining rates of undernourishment in recent decades. An estimated 821 million people remain undernourished globally. While great progress was made in tackling hunger from 2000 to 2015, with undernourishment declining at an average annual rate of 1.6% according to the FAO, the pace of progress has slowed to 0.5% since 2015 according to the latest UNDP estimates. At the current rate of progress, 6% of the world's population will still be undernourished in 2030, missing the zero hunger target.   

Malnutrition in all its forms continues to affect people all over the world. An estimated 49 million children under 5 years of age are affected by wasting, 14 million are severely wasted and 149 million are stunted due to chronic undernutrition. Meanwhile, adult obesity is on the rise in nearly all countries, putting pressure on healthcare systems. Urgent action is needed to meet nutrition targets and promote healthy diets.

In terms of sustainable agriculture and food production systems, some progress is being made but major efforts are still needed. Investments in sustainable agricultural research and development have increased but remain insufficient to achieve sustainable food security. Government support for sustainable agriculture needs to at least double, even triple, to meet the SDG 2 targets according to UNDP analysis. Transitioning to more sustainable production methods will require addressing a range of issues including water usage, pollution, and biodiversity loss.  

In summary, while the long-term trend of declining hunger continues, accelerated action and increased investments are urgently needed to achieve SDG 2 targets. Governments, the private sector, civil society and individuals must work together to ensure sustainable food security for all by 2030, leaving no one behind. With increased political will and a revitalized global partnership for sustainable development, ending hunger remains within our reach. But the next decade is crucial – the 2020s must be a decade of action on SDG 2.


 Here is a draft long-form analytical report on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of UNCTAD for an expert audience:

SDG 2: Progress and Challenges in Ending Global Hunger  

Despite significant progress over the past decades, hunger and malnutrition remain pressing global challenges. According to the latest FAO estimates, 821 million people worldwide were undernourished in 2018, the third year in a row that global hunger has risen. Achieving SDG 2 will require a rapid acceleration of current trajectories as well as innovative new approaches to tackle the complex and interconnected drivers of hunger.

One of the most significant obstacles is conflict, which continues to drive food insecurity around the world. In 2018, 113 million people experienced acute hunger due to conflict, violence and insecurity, particularly in parts of Africa and the Middle East. Providing humanitarian assistance and protecting access to food in conflict areas must be a top priority. However, humanitarian aid alone will not address the long-term need to build resilient food systems that can withstand shocks. This requires investments in agriculture, rural development, and social protections that specifically target the most vulnerable groups.  

Climate change is also undermining progress on SDG 2 by posing severe risks to food production and availability. Changes in weather patterns are already impacting crop yields and fisheries in many parts of the world. Adopting climate-smart agricultural practices, crop diversification, disaster risk reduction and management are critical to building resilience. At the same time, reducing food loss and waste can have significant benefits for mitigating and adapting to climate change. An estimated 30% of all food produced is lost or wasted globally each year, contributing 8% of total greenhouse gas emissions. New partnerships and technologies are needed to improve harvesting, storage, transport, and distribution infrastructure especially in developing countries.

Trade policies and macroeconomic factors also strongly influence progress on SDG 2. Reducing trade-distorting subsidies, preventing price volatility and ensuring that trade policies support rather than undermine domestic agricultural production in developing countries are key measures that can be taken. Access to finance and credit for smallholder farmers remains limited in many parts of the world, hindering their ability to invest in improved inputs, equipment and technologies to boost yields and incomes. Development partners should work to expand financial inclusion and innovative financing mechanisms that specifically target small-scale food producers.  

In summary, ending hunger will require coordinated efforts across sectors and at all levels to strengthen food systems, protect the vulnerable, build resilience in the face of climate change, and ensure that macroeconomic and trade policies support agricultural development in poorer nations. With only 10 years left to achieve the SDGs, progress on SDG 2 is lagging and a substantial acceleration of action is urgently needed to end global hunger by 2030. Business-as-usual approaches will not suffice. Through partnerships, innovation and political will, zero hunger can be achieved. But the time for action is now.


 Here is a draft long-form analytical report on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Africa targeting an expert audience:

SDG 2: Progress on Ending Hunger in Africa 

Africa has made uneven progress towards achieving SDG 2 and ending hunger across the continent. While many countries have seen improvements in key hunger indicators, much more needs to be done to reach the ambitious targets set out in the 2030 Agenda.

According to the latest UN progress report on the SDGs, the prevalence of undernourishment in Africa has declined from 28.1% in 2000 to 19.1% in 2018. However, this still means that over 250 million people in Africa experience hunger on a daily basis. At the current rate of progress, Africa will not achieve the SDG 2.2 target of ending hunger by 2030. Accelerated action is urgently needed across sectors and at regional, national and local levels to end hunger in Africa within the next decade.

In terms of specific targets under SDG 2:

Target 2.1 (access to food): The proportion of the population with adequate access to food in Africa increased from 61% in 2000 to 65.9% in 2018 according to FAO estimates. However, due to population growth, the total number of people without adequate access to food has not declined significantly. More investments are needed in sustainable agriculture, income generation, and social protection programs to improve access to food across the region.

Target 2.2 (end malnourishment): As noted above, the prevalence of undernourishment in Africa declined by only 9 percentage points between 2000 to 2018 according to UN estimates. At the current rate, Africa will not achieve the target of ending hunger by 2030. Concerted policy efforts and investments in nutrition, sustainable food systems and resilience-building are required to accelerate progress. 

Target 2.4 (sustainable food production): There have been some improvements in agricultural productivity and income of small-scale food producers in parts of Africa, but more needs to be done...[continues with analysis of other targets and indicators under SDG 2, challenges, key recommendations]

In summary, while there has been some progress on hunger reduction in Africa at the aggregate level, significant challenges remain to achieve SDG 2 targets by 2030. Transformative changes are needed to address the systemic issues driving hunger on the continent, including through policy and partnerships at all levels to build sustainable food systems, improve agricultural productivity, increase rural incomes and make nutritious diets available and affordable for all Africans. Achieving Zero Hunger in Africa is possible with political will and targeted investments towards a shared vision of a food-secure future for all.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UNECE targeting an expert audience:

Progress on SDG 2: Zero Hunger in the UNECE Region

Goal 2 of the Sustainable Development Goals aims to "End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture" by 2030. As we enter the decade of action and delivery for the SDGs, ensuring progress on SDG 2 remains urgent for countries in the UNECE region. 

Despite economic growth in recent decades, hunger and food insecurity persist in pockets of the UNECE region. According to the latest estimates, over 15 million people in the region suffer from undernourishment. While some countries have nearly eradicated hunger, in others over 10% of the population remains undernourished. Rural populations, indigenous groups and people in conflict-affected areas tend to be disproportionately affected. Tackling hunger will require targeted policy interventions to reach the most vulnerable.

Challenges to food security like climate change, loss of biodiversity, and inequality are intensifying in the region. Changes in weather patterns are already impacting agricultural yields in some parts of the region. Biodiversity loss threatens the resilience of food systems. And poverty and lack of access to resources prevent many farmers from adopting sustainable practices. Countries must take urgent action to strengthen the resilience of food systems and support livelihoods of small-scale food producers. 

Progress on nutrition and health remains uneven across countries. Overweight and obesity are rising rapidly in nearly all countries, while many still suffer from undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. Policymakers should promote nutrition education, regulation of food marketing, and incentives for production and consumption of nutritious foods. 

Sustainable food production in the region needs improvement to reduce environmental impacts. Agriculture accounts for over 20% of greenhouse gas emissions in the region. Pollution from excessive fertilizer and pesticide use threatens ecosystems and human health. Countries should provide farmers support to transition to more sustainable and eco-friendly production systems like agroecology, precision agriculture, and organic farming.

In summary, while some progress has been achieved on SDG 2 in the UNECE region, accelerated efforts are needed to end hunger, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable food systems. Tackling hunger and malnutrition in all its forms will require targeted interventions to reach the most vulnerable groups. And transitioning to sustainable food systems is critical to build the resilience needed to overcome intensifying challenges like climate change and biodiversity loss. Partnerships across sectors and stakeholders will be instrumental to progress on SDG 2 in the coming decade.


 Here is a draft fictional long analytical report in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) on the current progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger):

The achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 2 on Zero Hunger remains challenging in the Latin American and Caribbean region. Despite some progress, millions of people continue to suffer from hunger, malnutrition, and food insecurity in our region. According to the latest estimates, 47 million people in Latin America and the Caribbean still suffer from hunger, especially in small island developing states and least developed countries. The region as a whole, and some countries in particular, face serious challenges in improving agricultural productivity, increasing rural incomes, and ensuring sustainable food production systems.  

The prevalence of undernourishment in the region was most recently estimated at 6.5% according to the UN’s State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report. This shows a slowdown in progress compared to previous years. The COVID-19 crisis has likely made the hunger situation even more severe, though lack of data has made this difficult to quantify. The crisis shows the fragility of our food systems and the vulnerability of the poor and marginalized to economic downturns.   

Agricultural productivity in the region continues to lag global averages, growing at only 1.3% per year compared to a world average of 1.7% from 2012 to 2017 according to FAO data. This is far from the target of doubling productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers. Nations must invest in agricultural research and development, technology transfer, and support for small farmers. Sustainable food production is also essential, as our region faces existential threats from climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation, and natural disasters. Transitioning to sustainable agricultural practices should be made an urgent priority.

Income inequality also remains a barrier, as poorer populations spend a higher proportion of their income on food. Social protection programs such as conditional cash transfers have been effective at reducing poverty and hunger for the most vulnerable. However, coverage and generosity of benefits remain uneven across countries. Stronger, better-funded social protection and antipoverty programs are needed to boost access to food for marginalized groups.  

In summary, while some nations have made progress on Goal 2, the overall pace of progress is too slow. Concerted action across sectors by governments, civil society, and private sector partners is needed to transform food systems, support producers, and assist the vulnerable. Policies and programs to boost agricultural productivity, build sustainable food systems, and reduce poverty must be scaled up rapidly to achieve Zero Hunger in Latin America and the Caribbean. Collective action and regional cooperation can help address this pressing challenge. Together, the region can achieve a sustainable food secure future for all.


 Here is a draft long-form analytical report on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), targeting an expert audience:

SDG 2: Progress on Zero Hunger in Asia and the Pacific 

Despite economic growth and poverty reduction over the past two decades, hunger and malnutrition persist in Asia and the Pacific. According to the latest estimates, over 500 million people in the region continue to suffer from hunger and insufficient access to food. Progress on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) has been uneven across countries and subregions. While some countries have achieved notable declines in undernourishment, stunted growth, and wasting, other countries have shown little to no progress. 

ESCAP’s analysis of national reports and data shows that Central Asia, East Asia, and South-East Asia are closer to achieving SDG 2 targets, while the Pacific subregion and some parts of South and South-West Asia are lagging. Major challenges include poverty, inequality, lack of agricultural development, natural disasters, and conflict. The COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating hunger and negatively impacting food security across the region due to job losses, economic downturns, and disrupted agricultural production and supply chains.

Achieving SDG 2 will require multisectoral policy actions and investments to build sustainable food systems and resilient agricultural practices. Countries should prioritize pro-poor agricultural policies, sustainable intensification, value chain development, nutrition programs, and social protection. Regional cooperation on data sharing, technology transfer, and policy learning can support national efforts. Development partners have a key role to play in providing technical and financial assistance.  

ESCAP calls upon member States to make ending hunger and improving nutrition a higher priority in national development plans and budgets. Countries that are furthest behind on SDG 2 targets should adopt time-bound hunger reduction strategies and nutrition action plans, with concrete policy actions and verifiable indicators to accelerate progress. Regional knowledge platforms and policy dialogues should be leveraged to share lessons and coordinate implementation of SDG 2 across Asia and the Pacific. Achieving Zero Hunger is critical for an inclusive and sustainable future for all in the region. With concerted actions, the ambitious goal of eradicating hunger in Asia and the Pacific by 2030 can be achieved.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture) in the style of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) targeting an expert audience:

Sustainable Development Goal 2: Progress and Challenges in the ESCWA Region  

The ESCWA region continues to make progress on SDG 2 but significant challenges remain, especially given increasing pressures from population growth, conflict, and climate change. According to the latest ESCWA estimates, the overall prevalence of undernourishment has decreased from around 15% in 2000 to 10% in 2017, meaning 52 million people in the region still suffer from hunger. However, this masks wide disparities across and within countries. Several countries have reached internationally agreed targets on undernourishment, but others, especially conflict-affected countries, have seen reversals in progress.  

Access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food remains elusive for many marginalized groups, including rural populations, women, and children. An estimated 7% of children under 5 years of age suffer from wasting, while 6% are overweight, demonstrating the persistent double burden of malnutrition in the region. Micronutrient deficiencies also continue to be a public health problem. 

Agricultural production has increased steadily over the past decades, but productivity gains have slowed. Investments in agriculture have declined, threatening future progress. Agricultural research and development remains limited, hindering the adoption of innovative, sustainable agricultural practices. Support for small-scale food producers also continues to be lacking. 

Water scarcity poses severe challenges. Agriculture accounts for over 80% of water use in many countries, but water extraction for farming is reaching or exceeding sustainable levels. Droughts have intensified in recent years, highlighting countries’ vulnerability to water shocks and the need for improved water management.

In summary, while gains have been achieved, more ambitious actions are urgently needed to meet SDG 2 in the region. Accelerating progress will require reinvigorating political commitments, scaling up investments in sustainable agriculture and food systems, conducting agriculture policy and governance reforms, and improving the targeting and coverage of nutrition and social protection programs to reach the most vulnerable groups. Regional cooperation will also be critical to addressing the transboundary challenges of hunger, malnutrition and sustainable agriculture in the ESCWA region.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report in the style of UN DESA on the progress of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in middle-income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 2: Achieving Zero Hunger in Middle-Income Countries  

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development set an ambitious target of achieving zero hunger by 2030 under SDG 2. While progress has been made in some areas, the world is not on track to eliminate hunger and malnutrition in middle-income countries according to the latest Secretary-General’s SDG progress report and reports from UN agencies such as UNDP, UNCTAD, and the regional commissions.  

Middle-income countries (MICs) face significant challenges in achieving SDG 2 due to issues like inequality, climate change impacts, and conflict. Despite experiencing fast economic growth, many MICs have high inequality which contributes to persistent poverty and hunger. As outlined in the 2019 UNDP Human Development Report, countries with high inequality have a harder time translating economic gains into human development progress including reducing hunger. Climate change is also undermining food security in MICs according to analyses from the ECA, ECLAC, and ESCAP. Droughts, floods, and changing weather patterns are damaging agricultural production and disproportionately impacting smallholder farmers and the poor in countries like South Africa, Brazil, India, and Thailand. Ongoing conflicts in some MICs like Iraq, Libya, and Syria have disrupted food systems leading to localized famines and increased reliance on food assistance according to WFP reports.  

To accelerate progress on SDG 2, UN DESA recommends MICs adopt more comprehensive, coordinated policy actions. As recommended in the Secretary-General’s SDG progress report, countries should increase investments in sustainable agriculture, build more resilient food systems, strengthen social protection programs, and improve food distribution infrastructure. ESCWA and UNDP also recommend improving data collection on hunger and malnutrition to better target policy interventions. Partnerships across governments, the private sector, and civil society will be key to mobilizing resources and expertise to eliminate hunger, especially in the face of significant challenges like inequality, climate change, and conflict.  

Progress on SDG 2 in MICs has been uneven and accelerated efforts are needed to achieve zero hunger by 2030. Comprehensive policy actions, increased investments, data-driven solutions, and partnership are critical to addressing the root causes of hunger and ensuring no one is left behind. Eliminating hunger in MICs is essential for global progress on SDG 2 and building a sustainable future for all.


 Here is a draft analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UN Economic Analysis and Policy Division (EAPD), focused on middle-income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger): Progress and Challenges in Middle-Income Countries  

While significant progress has been made in reducing hunger worldwide, food insecurity and malnutrition remain challenges in many countries, including middle-income countries (MICs). According to the latest estimates, nearly 690 million people globally still experience hunger, over 70% of whom live in middle-income countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Despite economic growth in many MICs, income inequality and lack of access to resources have made it difficult for the poorest populations to afford nutritious food or adapt to climate change impacts affecting agriculture.   

In Asia, the region with the largest number of undernourished people, Southern Asia has struggled in particular. Despite strong economic growth, nearly 281 million in Southern Asia remain undernourished. Inequality and poverty have limited access to nutritious food, especially for rural populations. Climate change has also brought droughts, heatwaves, and changing weather patterns that have threatened agricultural production and livelihoods. In sub-Saharan Africa, undernourishment has declined in recent years but still affects over 210 million people. Poverty, conflict, and climate change continue to undermine food security, especially for pastoralists and smallholder farmers. 

Latin American countries have made the most progress in reducing hunger, yet nearly 44 million still face undernourishment. Income inequality, poverty, and lack of social protections have hindered access to nutritious food for the poor, rural, and indigenous populations. Economic crises and natural disasters have also weakened food security. Promoting sustainable agriculture, improving rural infrastructure, and expanding social safety nets are needed to accelerate progress.

In summary, while notable achievements have been made, more must be done to meet SDG 2 in MICs. Reducing inequality and poverty, scaling climate-smart agriculture, building resilience to natural disasters, and strengthening rural development and social protections are critical to overcoming the structural barriers to achieving Zero Hunger. With global cooperation, adequate funding, and sharing of best practices, MICs can end hunger within the next decade. But without immediate intervention, the steep increase in population growth combined with the existential threat of climate change may undermine progress already achieved.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations:

Progress on Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger - An Analysis of Trends in Middle-Income Countries 

While considerable progress has been made on reducing hunger globally, there are still nearly 690 million people that are undernourished worldwide, the vast majority of whom live in middle-income countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean. According to the latest estimates from the Food and Agriculture Organization, the proportion of undernourished people has slowly but steadily declined in middle-income countries over the past decade, from 13.5% in 2010 to 11.0% in 2018. However, due to population growth, the total number of undernourished people has remained largely unchanged. Achieving SDG 2 will require accelerated progress, especially in the most vulnerable middle-income countries and populations.  

The lack of progress is most pronounced in countries experiencing conflict or climate-related disasters. As the UN Secretary-General has noted, hunger is on the rise in some middle-income countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, and Zimbabwe, reversing decades of progress in hunger reduction. There is an urgent need for coordinated action to strengthen resilience and social protection systems to shocks in these countries. Regional organizations like the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have made strides in harmonizing agriculture and food policies across countries, but greater regional and international cooperation is still needed.  

Rural middle-income populations, particularly smallholder farmers and indigenous groups, remain disproportionately affected by hunger due to lack of access to productive resources, markets, and economic opportunity. Women are particularly disadvantaged, as they face greater barriers to land access and agricultural inputs. Promoting women's empowerment through access to resources, education, and skills training must be a priority to achieve Zero Hunger. Youth populations also face high unemployment and job insecurity, contributing to urban hunger in some middle-income countries.

[The report would continue with several more paragraphs discussing trends, challenges, and policy recommendations for middle-income countries under SDG 2].


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UN DESA Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DISD) targeting an expert audience and focused on middle-income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 2: Current Status and Challenges in Middle-Income Countries  

Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to "end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture" by 2030. This goal includes targets related to ending hunger, malnutrition, and poverty, doubling agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, ensuring sustainable food production systems, maintaining genetic diversity, and implementing resilient agricultural practices.

Progress on SDG 2 remains mixed, especially in middle-income countries. According to the UN's 2019 SDG Progress Report, the proportion of undernourished people in lower-middle and upper-middle income countries has declined, but at a slower rate than needed to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030. In some countries, the absolute number of undernourished and food insecure people is increasing due to population growth. Climate change-related disasters and conflicts have also intensified food insecurity in some middle-income countries. 

While stunting rates have declined in middle-income countries, one in four children under five years of age remains stunted. Overweight and obesity rates are also rising rapidly, demonstrating the double burden of malnutrition facing these countries. Sustainable agricultural production and resilient food systems face challenges from biodiversity loss, pollution, desertification, and water scarcity. Small-scale food producers face difficulties accessing resources, technologies, and markets to improve productivity and incomes.

To accelerate progress, middle-income countries should increase investments in sustainable agriculture, small-scale producer support, social protection programs, and nutrition initiatives. Countries should strengthen policies and programs to end hunger and all forms of malnutrition, including through school feeding programs, public distribution systems, and conditional cash transfers. Promoting climate-resilient technologies, diversified and sustainable food production systems, and livelihood opportunities in rural areas can foster greater food security and agricultural sustainability.

In summary, while moderate gains have been achieved in some areas related to SDG 2 in middle-income countries, urgent action is needed to end hunger, promote sustainable agriculture, and improve nutrition to achieve this goal by 2030 according to SDG targets and indicators. With increased investments, policy reforms, technology adoption, and programmatic interventions, middle-income countries can accelerate progress on Zero Hunger and build sustainable and equitable food systems.


 Here is a draft analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2): End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture, in the style of the UN DESA Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DSDG):

Executive Summary: Progress on SDG 2 in middle-income countries continues to move in a positive direction, however significant challenges remain, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic disruptions, and climate change impacts. Achieving food security and improved nutrition by 2030 will require accelerated action and investment.  

Targets and indicators: SDG 2 has 8 targets measured by 14 indicators focusing on hunger, food insecurity, malnutrition, agricultural productivity, income of small-scale food producers, genetic diversity, and investment in rural infrastructure. Key indicators include the prevalence of undernutrition (2.1.1) and the proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture (2.4.1). Progress on these indicators has been uneven across the diverse group of middle-income countries.

Root causes of hunger: The main drivers of hunger and food insecurity in middle-income countries include poverty and inequality, especially in rural areas; low agricultural productivity and incomes; lack of investment in agriculture; lack of rural infrastructure; effects of climate change; conflict and instability; and economic shocks. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated many of these factors, highlighting the vulnerability of food systems.  

Progress and challenges: According to the 2020 edition of The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, the prevalence of undernourishment has increased in some middle-income countries in Africa and Latin America, though there has also been good progress in other countries. Many countries have expanded social safety nets and school feeding programs, however per capita food availability remains insufficient in some countries. Agricultural productivity has grown but often not quickly enough. Climate change is hampering progress through increased frequency/severity of droughts and other extreme weather events.   

Recommendations: Accelerated action is needed in the following areas: (1) Increased investment in agricultural research, development, and extension services; (2) Rural infrastructure development including irrigation, storage facilities and transport; (3) Climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies for agriculture; (4) Expanded and more comprehensive social safety nets and nutrition programs; (5) Trade policy reform and reduced market distortions to enable greater agricultural trade; (6) Increased focus on crop diversity, sustainable farming practices, and access to resources for smallholder farmers, especially women; (7) Greater policy coherence across sectors; (8) Improved data collection and monitoring systems.   

With concerted action across these areas, significant progress can be made on SDG 2 in middle-income countries, however the goals will still be challenging to achieve by 2030 for many countries without additional resources and international support. Continued progress reports tracking SDG 2 should provide recommendations tailored to the capacities and contexts of specific middle-income countries and subregions.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DSDG):

Sustainable Development Goal 2: Progress and Challenges in Middle-Income Countries  

Middle-income countries (MICs) have seen steady progress on SDG 2 targets related to hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition over the past decade. According to the latest estimates, the proportion of undernourished people in MICs declined from 15.3% in 2000-2004 to 10.8% in 2016-2020. However, the pace of progress has slowed in recent years and tens of millions still suffer from chronic hunger. Urgent action is needed to reinvigorate efforts and address growing inequalities in access to food.  

Despite economic growth, poverty and inequality persist in many MICs, limiting access to affordable nutritious foods for the poorest and most vulnerable groups. National surveys show that in nearly all MIC regions, including in Latin America and the Caribbean, the incidence of undernourishment and food insecurity is higher in rural areas and among less educated households. Indigenous peoples, refugees, and marginalized ethnic groups often face significantly higher rates of hunger and malnutrition. Targeted programs are needed to reach these vulnerable populations.

While most MICs have seen a decline in child stunting, one in four children under five years of age remains stunted, and progress on other forms of malnutrition has been limited. Wasting in children and anaemia in women of reproductive age remain at medium to high levels in several regions. Overweight, obesity and diet-related diseases are also rising rapidly, demonstrating the double burden of malnutrition that many MICs face. Urgent policy actions across food, agriculture, and health systems are needed to address this complex problem in a comprehensive manner. 

Agricultural production has kept pace with population growth in most MIC regions, but yields and productivity growth have slowed. Environmental degradation, biodiversity loss, and climate change impacts threaten future harvests. Many small-scale farmers struggle with lack of access to resources, technology, and climate-smart practices. Increased public and private investments in sustainable agriculture are critical to boosting resilient food production systems that can feed a growing and increasingly urbanized population in MICs while safeguarding natural resources.

In summary, while MICs have seen progress, more ambitious actions across sectors at all levels are urgently needed to achieve SDG 2. Domestic resource mobilization, international cooperation, pro-poor policies, and leveraging community capacity must all be prioritized to end hunger, improve food security and promote sustainable agriculture for healthy lives in these countries. Collective action can help ensure the right to food for all in middle-income countries.


 Here is a draft long-form fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UNDP targeting an expert audience and focused on middle-income countries:

Progress on Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger in Middle-Income Countries

Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to "end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture" by 2030. This report analyzes the current status of SDG 2 progress in middle-income countries based on the latest data and reports from the UN system including UN DESA, FAO, WFP and the five UN regional commissions. 

Middle-income countries have seen steady declines in extreme poverty and hunger rates in recent decades, with the extreme poverty rate declining from 35.9% in 1990 to 9.9% in 2018 according to the World Bank. However, middle-income countries still account for 62% of the world's poor and progress on reducing hunger has stalled in some regions. According to the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2020 report, the number of undernourished people in middle-income countries rose from 375.1 million in 2014 to 381.9 million in 2018. Climate change, economic slowdowns and inequality are threatening to reverse gains that have been made. 

In East and South Asia, while the extreme poverty rate has declined substantially, undernutrition and obesity rates remain high and are rising in some countries. In China and India, two of the world's most populous middle-income countries, obesity rates have tripled over the last few decades. At the same time, in South Asia, over 15% of the population remains undernourished according to FAO estimates. In Latin America and the Caribbean, undernourishment has declined but plateaued at around 6.5% of the population over the last few years. Economic crises and droughts linked to climate change are hampering further progress. In the Middle East and North Africa, conflict and economic shocks have led to higher undernourishment rates, now over 9% in some countries and rising.

[The report would continue with many additional details on trends in specific indicators like stunting rates, exclusive breastfeeding, food insecurity, agricultural subsidies and investments, and Policy recommendations from UN agencies to address challenges and accelerate progress.]

In summary, while extreme poverty and hunger have declined steadily in most middle-income countries, undernutrition remains a challenge and the rate of progress is slowing or even reversing in some regions. Concerted policy action and investments are needed to reinvigorate progress on SDG 2 and ensure the goal of Zero Hunger is achieved by 2030 in middle-income countries. With political will and cooperation, overcoming regional disparities and reaching the most vulnerable populations, ending hunger is still possible.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on the progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) from the perspective of UNCTAD, targeting an expert audience and focused on middle-income countries:

Progress on SDG 2 in Middle-Income Countries: A UNCTAD Perspective  

Despite overall progress on reducing hunger globally, food insecurity and malnutrition remain significant challenges, especially in many middle-income countries. According to the latest UN report on SDG progress, the number of undernourished people in middle-income countries has been on the rise since 2014, and is now estimated at over 500 million. Major factors driving this trend include economic slowdowns, inequality, climate change impacts, and conflict. 

In East and South Asia, economic growth has lifted millions out of poverty but hunger reduction has stagnated. Inequality remains high and there are concerns that economic gains are not reaching the poorest segments of the population. The impacts of climate change are also contributing to food insecurity in the region, with major droughts or floods damaging agricultural output and livelihoods. Countries like India, Indonesia and the Philippines must strengthen social safety nets, invest in climate-resilient agriculture, and improve distribution systems to address hunger.

In Latin America and the Caribbean, the economic crisis of recent years has reversed progress on hunger reduction, with undernourishment rates rising sharply in countries like Argentina and Venezuela. Poverty, inequality, and lack of economic opportunity remain challenges. Countries should focus on diversifying agricultural production, improving value chains to benefit small farmers, and strengthening cash transfer programs targeting the poor.  

Sub-Saharan Africa continues to have the highest prevalence of hunger, with over 200 million undernourished people. Rapid population growth, conflict, climate change, and lack of agricultural investment have hampered progress. Most countries are not on track to meet the Zero Hunger targets. Governments and development partners must scale up efforts to increase agricultural productivity, build resilience, empower women, and strengthen food systems. Increased financing for agriculture and social protection are urgently needed.

In conclusion, while SDG 2 is lagging in many middle-income countries, enhanced policy action and investment in sustainable agriculture, social protection, and equitable growth can help put countries back on track to ending hunger within the next decade. But greater cooperation and partnerships will be required to tackle challenges like inequality, climate change and economic shocks that often transcend national borders. With only ten years left to achieve the 2030 Agenda, now is the time for concerted efforts across all sectors to ensure no one is left behind.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Africa targeting an expert audience with a focus on middle-income countries:

Progress on SDG 2: Zero Hunger in Middle-Income Countries  

While many countries have made progress on reducing hunger and improving nutrition over the past decades, there is still much work to be done to achieve SDG 2, especially in middle-income countries. According to the latest UN reports, the world is not on track to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030.  

Middle-income countries in Africa have seen economic growth in recent years, but this growth has not translated into improved food security and nutrition for much of the population. Poverty and lack of access to nutritious food remain major challenges. The factors driving hunger and malnutrition in these countries are complex and interlinked. Key issues include:

•Inequality and lack of social protections: While economies are growing overall, much of the benefits are concentrated among elites. Large segments of the population remain in poverty with limited access to resources and nutritious food. Existing social programs are poorly targeted.  

•Smallholder challenges: Smallholder farmers make up a significant portion of the population in many middle-income African countries, but they struggle with lack of inputs, training, access to markets, and vulnerability to climate change impacts like droughts. This makes it difficult for them to adopt sustainable agricultural practices or improve their livelihoods.   

•Climate change: Changes in climate are already negatively impacting agricultural production in many regions. More frequent droughts and weather extremes threaten food security, especially for vulnerable smallholder farmers. There is a need for adaptation and resilience strategies.  

•Conflicts and crises: Humanitarian crises caused by conflicts, natural disasters and other factors disrupt agricultural activity, damage infrastructure, and force migration - all of which put pressure on food systems. Refugees and internally displaced people are especially at risk of hunger.  

•Dietary changes: Many middle-income countries are experiencing a “nutrition transition” with diets shifting to more processed foods, fats, and sugars as populations become more urbanized. This leads to health issues like obesity and non-communicable diseases alongside persistent undernutrition.

 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Europe, targeting an expert audience and with a focus on middle-income countries:

Progress on Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger in Middle-Income Countries  

While significant progress has been made in reducing hunger and malnutrition around the world, millions of people in middle-income countries still suffer from food insecurity and lack of access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food. According to the latest estimates, there are over 800 million undernourished people worldwide, over 500 million of whom live in middle-income countries. Despite economic growth, poverty and inequality remain challenges and key drivers of hunger in these countries. 

In countries like India, Nigeria, and Brazil, economic growth has not translated into proportionate improvements in food security and nutrition. While incomes and access to basic services have improved for some, large segments of the population still lack access to affordable nutritious foods. Diets are heavily based on starchy staples like rice, wheat, and maize, rather than more nutritious foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes, and animal-source proteins. Many smallholder farmers and subsistence farmers also remain in extreme poverty and are net food buyers, making them vulnerable to price shocks and fluctuations.

Women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger and malnutrition. Discriminatory social norms often limit women’s access to resources like land, credit, agricultural inputs, and technologies. Women farmers also have less access to agricultural extension and training services. Empowering women through education, economic opportunities, and participation in decision making at all levels of society is critical to progress on SDG 2.

While some middle-income countries like China have made remarkable gains in reducing hunger, sustainable solutions at scale are still needed.  Ending hunger will require integrated action across sectors and stakeholders. Governments need to prioritize investments in sustainable agriculture, social protection programs, infrastructure, and rural development. The international community must support national plans through development aid, knowledge sharing, and partnerships. Achieving zero hunger by 2030 is challenging but within reach if we mobilize the political will and resources to scale up evidence-based solutions. Together, we can end hunger and build sustainable food systems that nourish both people and planet.


 Here is a draft long analytical report on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) focused on middle-income countries:

Progress on SDG 2: Zero Hunger in Middle-Income Countries: An Analysis  

Middle-income countries have seen steady progress on reducing hunger and improving food security over the past decade, but significant challenges remain to achieve SDG 2 targets by 2030. According to the latest UN reports, the prevalence of undernourishment in middle-income countries declined from 13.5% in 2000-2004 to 8.9% in 2017, affecting 265 million people. However, the pace of progress needs to accelerate to meet the target of less than 3% by 2030. 

One of the biggest challenges is addressing inequality in access to food. While overall hunger has declined in most middle-income countries, disadvantaged populations still face high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition. Rural populations, women, children, indigenous groups and other minorities continue to be disproportionately affected by hunger. Tackling inequalities will require targeted policy interventions, social safety nets and nutrition programs for the most vulnerable groups.

Climate change is another obstacle, as it leads to loss of agricultural productivity, more frequent extreme weather events and food supply chain disruptions. Investing in sustainable food production systems, agricultural innovation, and resilient agricultural practices will be key to improving food security under a changing climate. New technologies like precision agriculture, biotechnology and renewable energy for agriculture can help increase yields while reducing environmental impacts.

Trade and economic factors also influence food security in middle-income countries. As countries continue on the path of economic development, diets are diversifying, and demand for resource-intensive agricultural commodities like meat, palm oil and cocoa is rising. This can strain domestic agricultural capacities and natural resources. On the other hand, greater integration into global trade networks also provides opportunities for economic growth in the agriculture sector. Facilitating trade, improving market access, and adding value to agricultural exports are important for long term food security.

In conclusion, while middle-income countries have made good progress, accelerated action is needed to achieve SDG 2. Tackling inequalities, building resilience to climate change, and promoting sustainable agricultural development and trade are critical for food security in the coming decade. With targeted policies and investments, ending hunger by 2030 can be within reach for many middle-income countries. But strong global partnerships and cooperation will also be needed to support the poorest and most vulnerable groups.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), focused on middle-income countries:

ESCAP Report on Progress Towards SDG 2 in Middle-Income Countries  

While many parts of the world have seen significant reductions in hunger and malnutrition over the past decades, progress on SDG 2 remains uneven across the Asia-Pacific region, especially in middle-income countries. According to the latest UN reports, an estimated 11% of the population in the Asia-Pacific region still suffer from hunger, and many countries are off track to achieve Target 2.1 on ending hunger by 2030.   

In East and North-East Asia, China has seen tremendous progress in reducing hunger, but hunger levels remain moderate to serious in Mongolia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and parts of South-East Asia like Indonesia, Philippines, and Timor-Leste. Political and economic instability have exacerbated hunger in Middle-Eastern countries like Syria, Yemen, and Iraq. Parts of Central Asia like Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan also continue to struggle with hunger amid economic challenges.   

A key driver of hunger in the region is rising economic inequality in many middle-income countries. While overall economic growth has lifted millions out of poverty, the benefits have not reached the poorest segments of the population. Rural populations also often suffer higher rates of hunger and poverty due to lack of job opportunities, low agricultural productivity, and poor market access. Climate change is an increasing threat, with more frequent droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events damaging crops and livelihoods across Asia and the Pacific.  

To accelerate progress on SDG 2, countries must strengthen and expand social safety net and welfare programs to reach the poorest and most vulnerable groups. Investing in smallholder farmers and sustainable agriculture is critical, including initiatives to improve access to finance, agricultural inputs, technology, and markets. Countries also need to build resilience to climate change by promoting climate-smart agriculture, crop diversification, and disaster risk reduction. 

Cross-border cooperation can help address hunger, for example, by improving management of fisheries and water resources in transboundary river basins. ESCAP calls upon member States to fulfill existing policy and financial commitments to end hunger, and to share knowledge and good practices to support the region’s zero hunger goals. By strengthening local food systems and leaving no one behind, the Asia-Pacific can build economies and societies where hunger and extreme poverty are a thing of the past.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) targeting an expert audience and with a focus on middle-income countries:

Progress on Sustainable Development Goal 2 in the ESCWA Region: An Analysis with Focus on Middle-Income Countries  

Despite significant economic growth in parts of the ESCWA region in recent decades, hunger and malnutrition remain persistent challenges that undermine the region’s sustainable development. Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to “end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture” by 2030. However, the latest data show that progress on SDG 2 targets related to undernourishment, malnutrition, small-scale food producers, and sustainable agricultural productivity remain off-track for most countries in the region, especially middle-income countries. 

Undernourishment persists in pockets of the region, especially in conflict-affected areas. The prevalence of undernourishment in the region stands at around 11% according to the latest FAO estimates, higher than the world average. Several middle-income countries like Egypt, Iraq and Yemen have levels of undernourishment significantly above the regional average, linked to issues like poverty, inequality, and instability. Reducing undernourishment will require targeted policy interventions to enhance social protection programs, boost agricultural production, and improve distribution networks to make nutritious foods more available and affordable.

Malnutrition, especially in the form of micronutrient deficiencies and obesity, is an increasing concern across the region. While stunting has declined in parts of the region, one in five children under five years of age are still stunted. Anemia affects around 30% of women of reproductive age in the region. At the same time, the region faces rising obesity, with around one quarter of the adult population obese. Tackling malnutrition will require multifaceted policy interventions including promoting infant and young child feeding practices, micronutrient supplementation, nutrition education, and policies to encourage balanced and nutritious diets.

Small-scale food producers, including smallholder farmers, pastoralists and fishers, produce a significant portion of the region’s food but face substantial challenges. These include lack of secure access to land and productive resources, limited access to finance and technology, weak integration into value chains, and vulnerability to climate change impacts. Providing targeted support to small-scale food producers, including through access to credit, extension services, and social protection, can help boost their productivity and incomes while also enhancing nutrition outcomes. 

In summary, while parts of the ESCWA region have achieved food security through sustained economic growth and investment in agriculture, significant challenges remain in achieving the targets of SDG 2, especially in middle-income countries. Concerted policy actions and regional cooperation are needed to end hunger, improve nutrition, and support small-scale food producers in a sustainable manner across the region. The Commission stands ready to support member States in sharing best practices and developing integrated policy frameworks to accelerate progress on this critical Goal and achieve zero hunger in the region by 2030.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs:

Sustainable Development Goal 2: Progress and Challenges in Achieving Zero Hunger  

Significant challenges remain in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2 to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture, especially in least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries. According to the latest estimates, the world is not on track to meet targets 2.1 (access to food) and 2.2 (malnutrition) by 2030. While the overall prevalence of undernutrition has decreased in recent decades, the absolute number of undernourished people has remained stubbornly high at over 820 million, the vast majority in developing countries. Climate change, conflict, and economic slowdowns threaten recent gains. Urgent action is needed through sustainable, multifaceted approaches tailored to local contexts.  

Access to food (Target 2.1) faces immense challenges, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Poverty, inequality, and lack of agricultural investment limit food access for the poorest households. In least developed countries, over 15% face severe food insecurity. Small island developing states are particularly vulnerable to natural disasters and climate change impacts that threaten food systems. For landlocked developing countries, high trade costs and lack of infrastructure hamper food imports and distribution. Improving agricultural productivity, increasing incomes and social protections, and facilitating trade and food assistance can help address these challenges. 

Malnutrition (Target 2.2) remains high, with over 149 million children under 5 years stunted, 49 million wasted, and 40 million overweight. Anemia affects over 32% of women of reproductive age. Climate change is projected to increase malnutrition through crop failures, spread of disease, and threat of disasters. Tackling malnutrition requires nutrition-sensitive agriculture, clean water and sanitation, healthcare access, and women's empowerment, in addition to direct nutrition interventions. Progress has been slowest in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, demanding action through both humanitarian aid and long-term development initiatives.

Sustainable agriculture (Target 2.4) is key to progress across SDG 2 but faces major threats, especially in developing countries with dependence on agriculture. Investment, training, and technology transfer are needed to support sustainable intensification and productivity growth while conserving natural resources. Strengthening resilience will be vital in least developed countries and small island developing states. Promoting diversified production systems, short supply chains, and improving value addition can benefit both farmers and consumers. 

[The response continues with additional details on all targets under SDG 2, challenges, current status, and recommendations for different country groups.]


 Here is a draft long analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UN Economic Analysis and Policy Division (EAPD):

Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to “end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture” by 2030. According to the UN Secretary-General’s latest SDG progress report, the world is not on track to achieve this goal, especially in least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries. 

Hunger and food insecurity remain pressing issues in many parts of the world, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. According to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, 821 million people worldwide suffered from hunger in 2018. While this number has declined from 931 million in 2000, the pace of progress is too slow. At the current rate of decline, about 650 million people would still be undernourished in 2030. The situation is most dire in sub-Saharan Africa, where the number of undernourished people has risen to over 256 million, up from 210 million in 2000. In Asia and the Pacific, progress has also stalled in recent years.

The challenges of ending hunger are particularly severe in least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) due to structural disadvantages. These countries often have underdeveloped agricultural sectors, lack of infrastructure, high transportation costs, vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change impacts, and constrained access to resources and technology. For example, in Haiti, a LDC in the Caribbean, nearly 60% of the population faces severe food insecurity due to low agricultural productivity, poverty, natural disasters, and political instability. In the Pacific SIDS, dependence on food imports and climate change threats are undermining food security. In the landlocked Central African Republic, 45% of the population suffers from hunger fueled by armed conflict, displacement, and reduced agricultural activity.

To accelerate progress on SDG 2, especially in the most vulnerable countries, increased investments are urgently needed to boost agricultural productivity, strengthen resilience, expand social safety nets, and promote multisectoral action. Developed countries should also increase development aid for agriculture and food security...

 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), targeting an expert audience:

Progress on Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger
A Report by the Development Policy and Analysis Division (DPIDG), Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA)

Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to "end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture" by 2030. This report provides an in-depth analysis of progress toward SDG 2, with a focus on challenges and opportunities in least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries.

Progress on SDG 2 indicators has been uneven across regions and country groups. While the prevalence of undernourishment has declined in some regions, millions still suffer from chronic hunger and food insecurity, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. Indicators on stunting, wasting, and overweight show that poor nutrition afflicts both developing and developed countries. Sustainable agricultural practices have expanded in some areas but more work is needed to increase resilience and productivity, especially for small-scale food producers in developing countries.

Challenges: Poverty, inequality, lack of agricultural investment, and climate change impacts threaten progress on SDG 2. Conflict and instability have disrupted agricultural production and access to food in some countries. Lack of capacity, technology, and agricultural research limit increases in productivity and resilience. In small island developing states, dependence on food imports and limited arable land pose challenges. In landlocked developing countries, lack of infrastructure and market access hinder agricultural trade.

Opportunities: Increased South-South cooperation, public-private partnerships, and sustainable financing mechanisms could help address these challenges. Investments in rural development, agricultural research, and technology can boost productivity and resilience. Social protection programs are key to reducing poverty and inequality. Responsible agricultural investments and improved market access may enhance food security.

Recommendations: To accelerate progress on SDG 2, especially in vulnerable country groups, the international community must: increase official development assistance for agriculture and rural development; improve policy coordination; support family farmers and smallholders; advance agricultural research and technology transfer; facilitate responsible private investments; enhance trade opportunities and market access; and strengthen social protection systems and disaster risk reduction programs. Urgent action is needed to meet the ambitious targets of SDG 2 and achieve a world without hunger.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DISD), targeting an expert audience:

Progress on Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger - A 2020 Analytical Review with Focus on Vulnerable Groups  

Despite significant economic growth in many parts of the world over the past decades, global hunger and food insecurity remain major challenges, made worse by climate change, conflict, and economic downturns. According to the latest estimates, nearly 690 million people, or 8.9 percent of the global population, are undernourished. After decades of decline, the trend appears to be reversing: the number of undernourished people has been slowly increasing since 2014. Vulnerable groups such as those in least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries have been hit the hardest. 

In least developed countries, the proportion of undernourished people is more than 15 percent. Poverty, lack of productive capacities, and dependence on primary commodities and foreign aid make these countries particularly vulnerable to food insecurity. Conflict and climate change have exacerbated problems. In small island developing states, a heavy reliance on food imports, limited agricultural land, vulnerability to climate change impacts like sea level rise and natural disasters severely constrain progress on SDG 2. Many landlocked developing countries face high transport and trade costs, and depend heavily on a few agricultural commodities, leaving them exposed to price volatility and natural disasters.

While global agricultural productivity has improved, production has not kept up with population growth and increases in demand. Climate change is projected to cause severe disruptions to agriculture, reducing yields and nutritional quality of crops, especially in vulnerable regions. Sustainable agricultural and food systems are urgently needed to adapt to and mitigate climate change, reduce vulnerability to price shocks and natural disasters, raise rural incomes, and improve nutrition. But increased public and private investments in agriculture, basic infrastructure, and social safety nets have not sufficiently targeted the poorest and most vulnerable groups. 

[The response continues with recommendations and examples of policy options, specific country case studies, data and statistics from UN reports, and additional details on challenges and solutions for vulnerable groups...]


 Here is a draft analytical report on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) in the requested style:

SDG 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture 

Progress on SDG 2 remains uneven across regions and country groups. According to the latest SDG progress report, while significant strides have been made in reducing hunger and malnutrition in some parts of the world, conflict, inequality, and economic slowdowns and downturns threaten to reverse hard-won gains. This is especially true for vulnerable groups like those in least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries.

Least developed countries (LDCs) continue to struggle in achieving SDG 2 targets. Undernourishment affects over 256 million people in LDCs, accounting for nearly 80 percent of the world's undernourished people. While the prevalence of undernourishment in LDCs has dropped from 44.5 percent in 2000 to 27 percent in 2018, the total number of undernourished people has actually increased over the same time period due to population growth. Dietary energy supply has increased in LDCs but remains well below the world average. Food insecurity also remains high, with over half of people in LDCs facing moderate or severe food insecurity. Progress on improving nutrition, especially reducing stunting in children, has been slow. Agriculture remains the main source of livelihoods for 70-80 percent of people in LDCs, yet investment in agriculture remains low. More needs to be done to support sustainable agricultural practices, strengthen social safety nets, and boost domestic food production in LDCs.  

Small island developing states (SIDS) face unique challenges in achieving SDG 2 due to their vulnerability to climate change impacts like more powerful storms, coastal erosion, and ocean acidification. These vulnerabilities threaten agricultural production, damage infrastructure, and disrupt trade and tourism, all of which undermine food security and incomes. While undernourishment has declined in SIDS from 25.4 percent in 2000 to 9.6 percent in 2018, one in five people still face moderate or severe food insecurity. Nutrition indicators show little progress, and some countries have seen recent increases in stunting and wasting. Heavy reliance on food imports leaves SIDS susceptible to price shocks and trade disruptions. More investment is needed in resilient agricultural practices, fisheries and tourism to strengthen domestic food production and economic opportunities.

Landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) face geographical disadvantages in accessing agricultural inputs and distributing food that hinder progress on SDG 2. Additional challenges include lack of infrastructure, limited arable land, and desertification. Undernourishment has declined but remains above 10 percent, and one-third of people face moderate or severe food insecurity. Stunting affects one in three children in LLDCs. While the agricultural sector employs over 60 percent of people in LLDCs, productivity remains low. International support for infrastructure development, trade facilitation, and adaptation of sustainable agricultural technologies is critical for LLDCs to improve food security and meet the SDG 2 targets.

In conclusion, vulnerable country groups like LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs require increased funding, capacity building and policy support to address the systemic challenges hindering progress on SDG 2. A coordinated response across government sectors and with development partners can help build resilience, boost agricultural production and increase access to affordable nutritious foods, moving us closer to a world free from hunger. But more action is urgently needed.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UN DESA's Financing for Sustainable Development Office (FSDO) targeting an expert audience:

SDG 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture  

Progress on SDG 2 remains slow, uneven, and insufficient, especially in least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). According to the 2019 SDG Progress Report, the number of undernourished people has risen to over 820 million globally. While some developing regions have made progress, rates of undernutrition and food insecurity remain high in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. The COVID-19 pandemic is projected to push up to 132 million more people into hunger, threatening to undo decades of progress. 

Promoting sustainable food systems and resilient agricultural practices is key to accelerating progress on SDG 2. Family farmers produce over 80 percent of the world's food, yet they face immense challenges accessing resources, technology, and markets. Greater investment is needed to support smallholder farmers, especially women farmers, in adopting sustainable practices and technologies. Improved access to inputs, services, credit, and land can help smallholders increase productivity and incomes sustainably.  

 LDCs and SIDS face unique challenges to achieving SDG 2 due to their vulnerability to climate change impacts, natural disasters, and economic shocks. These countries rely heavily on agriculture but face significant productivity gaps. They have limited access to technology, irrigation, and agricultural support systems. Targeted investments in climate-resilient infrastructure, early warning systems, and safety nets can help build resilience. South-South and triangular cooperation can facilitate the transfer of appropriate technologies and knowledge to support agricultural development.  

Changes in consumption patterns and reduced food loss and waste can also support progress on SDG 2. Shifting to sustainable diets can reduce the environmental impact of food systems while improving health and nutrition. Food loss and waste account for over 30 percent of total food produced - reducing this can increase the availability of food. Policies and initiatives aimed at changing behaviors around sustainable consumption and production are critically needed.

Overall, achieving SDG 2 will require a coordinated global effort to transform food systems and agriculture to be more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient. Urgent action is needed to support the livelihoods and access to resources for smallholder farmers and vulnerable populations in the face of immense challenges like climate change and COVID-19. With increased investment and international cooperation, zero hunger can be achieved.


 Here is a draft long-form analytical report on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of a UNDP report targeting an expert audience:

SDG 2: Progress on Ending Hunger Remains Uneven and Insufficient 

While global hunger has declined in recent decades, current rates of progress are insufficient to meet the ambitious targets set out in SDG 2 by 2030. According to the latest estimates, 821 million people worldwide still suffer from chronic undernourishment. This is unacceptable in a world of plenty. Urgent action is needed to accelerate progress, especially in the poorest and most vulnerable countries.

Least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS) continue to suffer disproportionately from hunger and food insecurity. In LDCs, around 236 million people face chronic hunger, accounting for over a quarter of the population. In SIDS, rates of undernourishment are 60% higher than the world average. These countries face significant challenges in agricultural productivity, poverty, governance, and resilience in the face of climate change. They require targeted assistance to develop sustainable food systems and social protection programs.  

Landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) also face major obstacles in connecting to global food markets and trade networks. On average, LLDCs have undernourishment rates 50% higher than other developing countries. They are heavily dependent on neighboring countries for access to ports and trade routes, and often face high transport costs, cumbersome border procedures, and political instability in transit countries. Improving transport infrastructure, trade facilitation, and regional cooperation should be priorities.

At the global level, the fight against hunger has been under-resourced. Official development assistance for agriculture in developing countries declined by over 60% between the 1980s and 2000s. While funding has increased in recent years, it remains well below the commitment made at the 2009 G8 Summit in L’Aquila, Italy. Additional investments in agricultural research, rural infrastructure, and social protection are urgently needed to meet SDG 2.   

In summary, greater political will and financial commitments are essential to accelerating progress on SDG 2. Targeted interventions should focus on the poorest and most vulnerable groups in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs. Partnerships across governments, civil society, the private sector and the UN system will be crucial to securing a world without hunger by 2030 and fulfilling the promise to leave no one behind. The stakes could not be higher, and now is the time for bold action.


 Here is a draft analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of UNCTAD targeting an expert audience:

Sustainable Development Goal 2: Current Progress and Challenges in Achieving Zero Hunger  

Ending hunger and achieving food security remains an immense challenge, especially in vulnerable countries. According to the latest FAO estimates, as of 2018 there were over 820 million undernourished people in the world, the vast majority in least developed countries, small island developing states and landlocked developing countries. While progress has been made in reducing extreme poverty, inequality and lack of access to resources continue to drive hunger. Conflict and climate change have also reversed progress in some areas.  

Achieving SDG 2 will require tackling the interconnected issues of poverty, inequality, agricultural productivity, sustainable food production systems, resilient agricultural practices, and fair trade. For least developed countries, small island developing states and landlocked developing countries, market access and trade are critical to improve incomes and fund imports of foods that cannot be produced locally. However, many remain at the margins of global trade and face high trade costs. Building productive capacities, developing sustainable value chains, and improving access to finance and technology are urgently needed.

Family farming remains the primary source of livelihoods and food security for many poor rural populations. Supporting smallholder farmers through secure land rights, financial services, and improved access to markets can help lift farmers out of poverty and improve food security. Sustainable farming practices should be promoted to adapt to climate change and preserve natural resources. Aquaculture and fisheries provide livelihoods for millions in coastal regions and small island states, so protecting marine resources and habitats is critical.   

Urban populations are growing, so improving food handling, storage, and distribution systems can reduce waste and improve access to nutritious food. Social safety nets are needed to provide food access for the poor and vulnerable. Nutrition education, especially for women, can help promote diet diversity and healthy eating. Access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene are also fundamental to health and nutrition.

In summary, achieving SDG 2 will require a coordinated global effort to promote agricultural development, reduce poverty and inequality, build resilience to climate change, improve nutrition and food access for vulnerable populations, reduce food loss and waste, support sustainable value chains, and improve market access and trade for the least developing countries. With concerted action across these areas, zero hunger can be achieved. But progress will require political will and coordinated support from UN agencies, donors, the private sector and civil society. Time is of the essence to meet this critical goal.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Africa targeting an expert audience:

Sustainable Development Goal 2: Progress and Challenges in Achieving Zero Hunger in Vulnerable Countries  

While global hunger has declined in recent decades, vulnerable groups of countries including least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS) and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) continue to face significant challenges in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2 and ensuring access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food for all people. This report examines the state of SDG 2 in these country groups based on the latest data and analysis from UN organizations including the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), UNICEF, World Food Programme (WFP) and others.  

In LDCs, the proportion of undernourished people has declined but still remains unacceptably high at over 20% according to the FAO. Poverty, natural disasters, and conflict continue to hamper progress. At the same time, overweight and obesity are rising rapidly in many LDCs, indicating a "double burden" of malnutrition. Agricultural productivity remains low due to lack of investment, infrastructure, access to inputs, and effects of climate change. Nutrition programs are underfunded and social safety nets are limited. Significant external assistance and investment will be needed to end hunger in LDCs.

SIDS face unique challenges to food security from natural disasters, overreliance on food imports, and limited agricultural land. As ocean populations decline, fish as a source of nutrition and livelihoods is threatened. Many SIDS have made progress on undernutrition but obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases are major concerns. There is a need for improved disaster risk reduction, investment in resilient agricultural systems, and policies to promote healthy diets. 

In LLDCs, hunger remains a significant concern with over 15% of people undernourished. Poverty, lack of infrastructure, and political instability hamper progress. Transporting food and agricultural inputs is difficult and expensive. There is heavy dependence on primary commodity exports. Agricultural research and development is limited. Regional cooperation on trade, infrastructure, and agricultural policy is critical to overcoming challenges related to lack of access in LLDCs.

In summary, while global trends show progress on SDG 2, vulnerable country groups in Africa face significant and diverse challenges in achieving zero hunger that require targeted policy interventions and investments to overcome. Concerted action across sectors and partners at global, regional and national levels is needed to end hunger and ensure sustainable food security for the poorest and most marginalized groups. Regional bodies have a key role to play to address root causes and support Member States in reaching this critical goal.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) targeting an expert audience:

Progress on SDG 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture  

SDG 2 aims to end hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030. It focuses on increasing access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food, especially for the poor and marginalized. According to the 2019 UN progress report on the SDGs, the world is not on track to achieve SDG 2. The number of undernourished people has risen to over 820 million. Conflict, climate change and economic downturns are hampering progress, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Urgent action is needed to accelerate progress, especially in least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS) and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) where populations remain disproportionately affected by hunger and malnutrition.

In LDCs, the prevalence of undernutrition remains worryingly high at over 20% according to the UN's SDG progress report. Food insecurity is rising in many LDCs due to conflict, climate change, and lack of investment in agriculture. In Haiti, for example, over half the population faces severe food insecurity. Agricultural development is key to reducing hunger in LDCs, but public investment in agriculture remains very low, below 10% in many countries. Increased foreign aid and private investment in sustainable agriculture and rural development are urgently needed. 

SIDS face unique challenges to achieving SDG 2 including limited arable land, vulnerability to climate change, and dependence on food imports. Many SIDS populations have high rates of obesity and micronutrient deficiencies despite apparent food security. The triple burden of malnutrition - undernutrition, overnutrition, and micronutrient deficiencies - is a major issue. Interventions should focus on developing sustainable food systems, reducing reliance on food imports and improving nutrition education. 

In LLDCs, the prevalence of undernourishment has declined but remains above 15% according to FAO. Poverty, lack of infrastructure, and inadequate market access are major barriers to reducing hunger and improving nutrition. Investing in transportation infrastructure, facilitating trade, and improving food storage and distribution systems should be priorities. Linking smallholder farmers to markets and food value chains can improve incomes and access to diverse, nutritious diets.  

In summary, accelerated progress on SDG 2 will require substantial investments in sustainable agriculture, rural development, social protection systems and nutrition interventions especially in LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs. Private sector involvement, South-South cooperation, and political commitment at all levels are also critically needed. The next decade is crucial to putting the world on track to achieve the vision of SDG 2 and eliminating hunger in all its forms.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of ECLAC and focused on vulnerable country groups:

SDG 2: Progress on Zero Hunger Remains Slow for Vulnerable Countries  

While global progress has been made on reducing hunger and improving food security and nutrition over the past decade, advancement on Sustainable Development Goal 2 remains uneven and vulnerable groups of countries continue to be left behind. According to the latest estimates, the number of undernourished people has dropped to 821 million worldwide, however, the pace of progress is too slow to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030. This is particularly the case for least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries which face unique challenges in achieving food security and improved nutrition due to their geographical remoteness, small size, and lack of economic diversification.  

For the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), undernutrition and malnutrition remain widespread problems that disproportionately impact women and children. The LDCs have the highest rates of stunting, with over 1/3 of children under 5 years of age affected. These countries also rely heavily on agriculture which is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. With populations growing at a rate of 2.4% per year, agricultural productivity and economic growth have not kept pace, limiting access to affordable nutritious foods. LDCs would require investments in rural infrastructure, agricultural research, and social protection programs to build resilience and improve food security.  

Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are also struggling to make headway on SDG 2 due to their small size, geographic isolation, and lack of agricultural diversity. Many SIDS are net food importers and their populations have some of the highest rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases which often co-exist with undernutrition. The high cost of living and economic dependence on tourism and imports make nutritious foods largely inaccessible for significant portions of the populations. Adaptation to climate change is urgently needed to safeguard scarce agricultural land and fisheries resources which many island populations depend on.

Landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) face significant obstacles in achieving SDG 2 due to lack of territorial access to the sea, remoteness, and isolation from world markets. Food insecurity in LLDCs is exacerbated by lack of infrastructure, low agricultural productivity, lack of economic diversification, and high poverty rates. Undernutrition in LLDCs disproportionately impacts marginalized groups and rural populations.  Investments in transport infrastructure, trade facilitation, food distribution networks, and agricultural research are critically needed to improve access to affordable nutritious foods.

In summary, while progress has been achieved globally on improving food security and nutrition, vulnerable country groups are not on track to achieve SDG 2 and will require targeted investments and approaches to build resilience, adapt to climate change, generate economic and agricultural growth, and make affordable nutritious diets accessible for all. A one-size-fits-all solution will not be effective, and strategies must be tailored to the unique challenges of each country group. With only 10 years left to achieve the 2030 Agenda, accelerated action is urgently needed to ensure no one is left behind.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) targeting an expert audience:

SDG 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture  

Progress on SDG 2 remains uneven across the Asia-Pacific region, with many least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries continuing to face significant challenges in achieving zero hunger. According to the latest estimates, more than 500 million people in the region still suffer from chronic food deprivation and malnutrition. Poverty and inequality remain major contributors to hunger, as do climate change impacts like droughts, floods, and changing weather patterns which pose risks to agricultural production and food security.  

Agricultural productivity in many countries remains low due to lack of investment in new technologies, irrigation systems, and farming practices. Smallholder and subsistence farmers make up a large portion of the agricultural workforce in the region but have limited access to resources, education, and training to improve their yields in a sustainable manner. Many countries also face high post-harvest food losses, estimated at up to 30-40% of total production, indicating weaknesses in storage, transportation, and distribution infrastructure as well as lack of value addition through food processing facilities.   

Nutrition indicators show persistently high levels of stunting, wasting, and micronutrient deficiencies in LDCs like Nepal, Cambodia and Lao PDR as well as in SIDS such as Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste. National food systems are not geared towards producing nutritious and affordable diets, and healthy food options are inaccessible for the poor. Promoting nutrition-sensitive agriculture and food systems is critical to overcoming malnutrition in its various forms across the region.

Sustainable agricultural practices including agroecology, conservation agriculture and agroforestry can enhance the resilience of food systems but adoption rates remain low. Many farmers lack knowledge about these techniques and incentives to transition to more sustainable practices. Countries must invest in research, development and extension services to promote sustainable agriculture and build the capacity of agricultural workers. 

In summary, significant efforts are still needed across Asia and the Pacific to meet SDG 2 targets, especially in the region’s most vulnerable countries. Urgent action is required to end hunger and malnutrition, promote sustainable food production systems, build resilient agricultural markets, improve rural infrastructure and access to resources for smallholder farmers. Regional cooperation on technology transfer, policy support and sharing of best practices can complement national level initiatives to accelerate progress on zero hunger. But political will and adequate financing are ultimately needed to transform agriculture and food systems to be sustainable, equitable, and support healthy diets for all.

Sustainable Development Goal 2: Progress and Challenges in Achieving Zero Hunger in Vulnerable Countries  

Eradicating hunger and malnutrition remains an immense challenge, especially in least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries. According to the latest UN reports, the world is not on track to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030. While some progress has been made in reducing undernourishment, the pace of progress has slowed in recent years due to increasing conflicts, climate change impacts, and economic downturns in vulnerable nations.

In least developed countries, around 15% of the population remains undernourished. Food insecurity is rising due to poverty, lack of agricultural infrastructure, and scarce economic opportunities. The productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers remain low. Many countries are dependent on imports for staple crops and are vulnerable to price shocks and trade disruptions. Climate change is posing severe threats to agricultural production and food security in these nations. 

Small island developing states face unique challenges in achieving SDG 2 due to their small size, isolation, and vulnerability to climate change impacts like sea level rise, cyclones, droughts, and coral bleaching. Most islands are net food importers, relying heavily on trade and facing high costs of living and limited agricultural land. Natural disasters frequently damage crops and infrastructure, and some islands have suffered substantial losses in agricultural output and fisheries. 

Landlocked developing countries often have underdeveloped infrastructure, small internal markets, and are distant from major trade hubs. This results in high trade costs, limited market access, and economic isolation. Many face 'imported inflation' as they rely on neighboring countries for imports and transport routes. Agriculture remains a major source of livelihoods but faces low productivity, lack of mechanization, and vulnerability to droughts and floods exacerbated by climate change.
