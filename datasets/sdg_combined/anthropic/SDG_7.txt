Affordable and Clean Energy for All Remains an Urgent Challenge

By the Assistant

Providing affordable, reliable and modern energy to all people and communities remains an unfinished goal and urgent challenge for the international community. Sustainable Development Goal 7 aims to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all" by 2030. But progress is off track, according to the latest report from the UN Secretary-General on the SDGs. 

Despite rapid gains in access to electricity in some regions of the world, over 1 billion people still lack access to electricity, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. And nearly 3 billion people still rely on unsafe and inefficient cooking solutions like wood and coal, contributing to millions of premature deaths each year from indoor air pollution. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the fact that access to basic electricity and clean cooking solutions is critical for human development, education, and health, said Liu Zhenmin, head of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs.

The transition to clean and sustainable energy sources is happening unevenly across the globe. While renewable energy is growing rapidly in some developed and developing countries, the overall share of renewables in the global energy mix, including in electricity, heating and transportation, needs to grow at a much faster rate to meet climate and development goals, according to the International Energy Agency. UN leaders have called for countries to end fossil fuel subsidies, which total over $500 billion per year globally, and instead incentivize a massive scale-up of public and private investment in renewable energy infrastructure and technologies. But some countries and companies remain committed to coal, oil and gas development.

Affordable and Clean Energy for All: Progress and Challenges on SDG 7

By Your Assistant

Access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy is crucial to achieving sustainable development and ending poverty. Sustainable Development Goal 7 aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030. This includes access to electricity, clean cooking fuels and technologies, and renewable energy. 

According to the UN Secretary-General's latest Sustainable Development Goals report, access to electricity in the world's least developed countries has more than doubled since 2000. The number of people without access to electricity declined from 1.2 billion in 2010 to 840 million in 2017. However, despite this progress, 13 percent of the world's population still lacks access to modern electricity. Rural and poor populations remain disproportionately affected. Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking has also steadily increased, but still over 2.8 billion people rely on traditional uses of biomass for cooking, leading to nearly 4 million deaths from illness linked to indoor air pollution, according to the World Health Organization.

Renewable energy is making progress as costs continue to fall and uptake accelerates, but renewable shares of total final energy consumption remain low at 17.5 percent. According to UNCTAD, investment in new renewable energy capacity needs to scale up dramatically, from around $250 billion per year currently to over $800 billion per year between now and 2030 to achieve SDG 7. The UN Secretary-General has called on governments, businesses and civil society to urgently strengthen policy commitments and mobilize partnerships focused on energy transitions in Africa, Southeast Asia and other regions. Regional initiatives like the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative by the African Union aim to accelerate renewable energy uptake.

Challenges remain around financing a massive scale-up of energy systems, especially to reach remote and poor communities. Sustainable energy needs to be at the heart of COVID-19 response and recovery efforts. Climate change poses additional threats that require transitioning rapidly to clean energy and greater energy efficiency. With less than 10 years left to achieve SDG 7, accelerated action and partnerships across governments, the private sector and civil society are urgently needed to provide sustainable energy for all. Overall progress is not fast enough and greater efforts are essential to achieving this goal and securing a sustainable future for everyone.

UN Urges Affordable and Clean Energy for All 
By Your AI Assistant

Access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy for all is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by UN Member States in 2015. SDG 7 aims to ensure universal access to affordable electricity by 2030 and increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. 

Progress on SDG 7 is mixed according to the latest UN report. While access to electricity in the world's least developed countries has increased by 20% in the past 5 years, 789 million people still lack access. Most of the growth has been in renewable energy, especially solar and wind, but fossil fuels still dominate the global energy system at about 81% of total primary energy supply. The share of renewable energy has only increased from 16.6% to 17.5% since 2010, far from the targets of SDG 7.

Greater efforts and accelerated action are urgently needed, the UN says. At the current pace, SDG 7 will not be achieved by 2030. The UN is calling on governments and private sector to increase investments in renewable energy and make solar and wind more affordable and accessible. Developing countries will need financial and technical support to expand renewable energy on and off-grid. The UN's Technology Facilitation Mechanism and the UN DESA and its regional commissions are working with countries on policy guidance, data monitoring and sharing of best practices.  

UNDP and UNCTAD warn the transition to sustainable energy may disrupt jobs and economies in the short term. The fossil fuel industry employs millions of people and makes up large parts of some countries' GDP. But long-term, the renewable energy sector has huge potential for new jobs in manufacturing, construction and other areas. With political will and the right policies and incentives, renewable energy can drive inclusive economic growth, the UN agencies say. 

In sum, SDG 7 is a crucial goal that can accelerate progress on multiple SDGs. But the clock is ticking. Urgent and ambitious action is needed to achieve affordable and clean energy for all within the next decade. The future of our planet depends on it. With cooperation and determination, a sustainable energy transformation is possible, the UN says. But the time for action is now.

The Urgent Quest for Sustainable and Affordable Energy For All  

By Your AI Assistant

Access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy is one of the greatest challenges facing our world today. According to the United Nations, nearly 1 billion people still live without electricity, predominantly in Sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia. Hundreds of millions more rely on dirty and dangerous sources like kerosene, charcoal and wood for cooking and heating.

Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) aims to address this immense challenge and "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all" by 2030. According to the UN's progress report on the SDGs, the world has made some progress on energy access, with the percentage of people with access to electricity reaching 89% in 2018, up from 83% in 2010. However, the rate of progress needs to accelerate significantly to achieve universal access by 2030. Parts of Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia still lag far behind. The UN has called on governments, private sector and development partners to increase investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies to make progress on SDG 7.

Renewable energy sources like solar, wind and hydro offer affordable and sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels that contribute to mitigating climate change as well. The costs of renewable technologies have declined significantly, with solar and wind the cheapest sources of new power generation in many parts of the world. The share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption reached 17.3% in 2018, up from 17% in 2015. However, the use of renewable energy in the heating and transportation sectors still remains very low relative to the electricity sector. Greater adoption of electric vehicles, electric heating systems and other renewable technologies across the economy will be critical to transitioning countries to sustainable energy systems and achieving SDG 7.

Greater energy efficiency can also play an important role in increasing access to sustainable energy...[additional details and statistics on energy efficiency, concluding thoughts]. Overall, despite some encouraging progress, the world remains off-track to achieve the promise of SDG 7 and universal access to sustainable energy for all people by 2030 without much more ambitious action from governments, businesses and organizations around the world. But with rapid advances in technology, greater political will and scaled up investments, achieving affordable and sustainable energy for all may still be within our grasp.

Achieving Universal Access to Affordable and Clean Energy by 2030

The seventh Sustainable Development Goal aims to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all" by 2030. According to the latest UN progress report, the world is not on track to achieve this goal. An estimated 789 million people still lack access to electricity, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Billions more rely on inefficient and polluting cooking fuels and technologies. The COVID-19 crisis has set back progress, but also highlighted the urgency of transitioning to more sustainable energy systems and the opportunity for "green" economic recovery. 

Expanding access to electricity and clean cooking remains a stubborn challenge. The rate of new connections has slowed, and the poorest and most vulnerable groups often remain unserved. Many countries lack the resources and technical capacity to scale up energy access. Population growth continues to outpace new connections in some regions. Instituting reliable energy access also requires strengthening power infrastructure and reducing transmission and distribution losses, which average over 9% globally. 

Investments in renewable energy have declined amid the economic crisis. At the same time, the crisis has prompted policy makers and investors to prioritize sustainable energy transitions to spur job creation and build more resilient systems. By some estimates, renewable energy employs over 10 million people already, and could generate millions of new jobs. Renewables are increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels, enhancing the economic case for green recoveries and long-term transition. The UN urges countries to invest in renewable energy, expand decentralized energy access, and improve energy efficiency.   

The road ahead remains long, but solutions and opportunities exist. With rapidly falling costs and improved storage, solar and wind power are poised for wider deployment. Leveraging private sector investment and regional cooperation can help overcome limited public resources.  Scalable and innovative models for rural electrification and clean cooking must be upscaled. Countries can capitalize on co-benefits like health and gender empowerment. Achieving SDG 7 will require political commitment to sustainable energy for the poorest groups, and recognition that clean, efficient and renewable energy underpins a sustainable future for all. Overall, while progress has been slow, the consensus on the importance and benefits of SDG 7 has only strengthened over time. With a decade left, the aim of energy access for all remains within reach if the world comes together to power a sustainable course.


 Here is a draft Op-ed in the style of Nicholas Kristof on Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all:

The Race to Light up the World

In the small village of Bihar in northern India, darkness still falls each evening like a shroud. The village has never had access to electricity, so when the sun sets, all activity stops. Children do homework by the dim light of kerosene lamps. Adults gather around fires to cook and socialize. 

We often take for granted that with the flick of a switch, we can illuminate our homes, power our appliances and get on with our lives after dark. Yet more than 1 billion people around the world still live in the shadows, lacking access to electricity. 

This is unacceptable and solvable. Sustainable Development Goal 7 aims to solve this energy poverty by 2030 through ensuring universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services. Access to sustainable energy is a catalyst for improving lives and livelihoods. It allows children to study after dark, powers agricultural equipment and food storage, enables access to digital connectivity and fuels small businesses.   

There has been progress. Since 2010, the number of people without access to electricity declined from 1.2 billion to 789 million, according to the latest UN report on progress toward the SDGs. However, the pace of progress needs to accelerate dramatically to achieve universal access within the next decade. The bulk of those gaining access live in Asia, while populations in Sub-Saharan Africa remain heavily in the dark.

The solution lies in renewable energy, like solar and wind, which can be deployed cheaply and quickly. Kenya is a leader in expanding solar energy through private companies offering pay-as-you-go solar home systems. Bangladesh has installed more than 5 million solar home systems. India aims to have 40% of its electricity from renewables by 2030. 

When a single light bulb is switched on for the first time in a village, it not only chases away the darkness but also illuminates better health outcomes, improved livelihoods, more connectivity and a pathway out of poverty. Universal access to sustainable energy must be an urgent global priority if we aim to live up to the motto of leaving no one behind. The world has promised to light up all households by 2030 - now we must make good on that promise. Our shared humanity demands nothing less.

The Case for Radical Transformation on Clean Energy 

By the Assistant

The world is not on track to meet the Sustainable Development Goal on affordable and clean energy, SDG 7, and it's time for a radical rethinking of our approach. According to the latest UN progress report, billions of people still lack access to electricity and clean cooking fuels, and the share of renewable energy in the global mix is increasing too slowly. At this pace, we will fall well short of the SDG 7 targets for universal access and doubling the renewable energy share by 2030.

What's missing is a real sense of urgency and the political will for rapid, far-reaching policy changes and massive investments in clean energy infrastructure. The costs of inaction are huge, as lack of access to modern energy disproportionately impacts the poorest and most vulnerable, while climate change caused by our dependence on fossil fuels threatens lives and livelihoods around the world. The solutions exist, including decentralized renewable energy systems, mini-grids, and new business models for energy access. What we need are leaders willing to drive a global Green New Deal to fund these solutions and transition us to a clean energy economy.  

There are some bright spots. China and Europe have made significant strides in renewable energy and lowering costs through ambitious policies and investments. But most countries are moving too cautiously, with incremental changes and modest subsidies or tax incentives for clean energy. To reach SDG 7, we need policies that radically reorder energy markets and infrastructure to favor clean energy, including ending all fossil fuel subsidies, carbon pricing, large public works programs, and incentives for residential solar and battery storage.   

Reaching SDG 7 will require cooperation between governments, international organizations, private sector and civil society. The UN and its agencies must continue to set more aggressive targets, share knowledge on what policies and programs work, and push countries to be more ambitious in their commitments. Development banks should dramatically boost funding for energy access and renewable projects. And private investors must step up to fund clean energy startups and scale successful new models.

With political will, rapid advances in technology, and global cooperation, achieving clean and affordable energy for all is within our reach. But we have no time to waste if we want to achieve SDG 7 and safeguard our planet. The time for radical transformation is now.


 Here is a draft Op-Ed in the style of Mark Whitehouse on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy):

The world urgently needs progress on sustainable energy access for all. Sustainable Development Goal 7 calls for affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for everyone by 2030. While there has been some progress, we remain dramatically off track to achieve this goal according to the latest reports from the United Nations. 

The annual Sustainable Development Goals Report notes that about 800 million people still lack access to electricity worldwide. Clean cooking facilities remain even worse, with 2.8 billion people without access to the most basic clean cooking fuels and technologies. Reliance on biomass for cooking and heating continues to pose grave health risks in the developing world. Despite this immense challenge, the Report finds that progress on affordable and clean energy access has been uneven and insufficient across countries.

Meanwhile, the UN's Economic and Social Council observes that COVID-19 threatens to roll back gains and that increased investment in sustainable energy is urgently needed in response. The pandemic has made the vulnerable even more susceptible, and disrupted access to electricity and clean cooking for millions of people. Targeted policy responses and investments in decentralized renewable energy, mini-grids and off-grid solutions are necessary to counter these impacts.   

National reports compiled by the regional UN Economic Commissions show some progress but call for accelerated action. For example, the Economic Commission for Africa finds that over 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa still lack access to electricity and almost 900 million lack access to clean cooking. The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean urges countries in the region to spur investment in renewable energy and transition away from fossil fuel dependence. Similar calls echo across the Asia-Pacific and Western Asia.

Multilateral organizations must scale up efforts. The UN Development Programme's energy access programmes reached over 100 million people worldwide but need far greater funding and ambition. UNCTAD has called for a 'Global Green New Deal' to invest in renewables and green infrastructure in developing countries. However, wealthy nations have yet to substantively increase climate and development finance.   

In summary, the world has a long way to go to achieve SDG 7, and the impacts of COVID-19 have only aggravated an already dire situation for energy access in many developing countries. Accelerated action through policy, finance, technology and capacity building is urgently needed to transition from fossil fuels to sustainable renewable energy for the many and not just the few. The stakes could not be higher in meeting this crucial Sustainable Development Goal. Our shared future depends on it.


 Here is a draft long-form article in the style of The Economist on Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all:

Affordable and Clean Energy: Powering the World 

Access to energy is fundamental to human development and economic growth. Yet billions of people around the world still lack access to reliable and affordable electricity or clean cooking facilities. Sustainable Development Goal 7 aims to change that by ensuring universal access to sustainable energy by 2030. 

Progress on SDG 7 has been steady but uneven across regions. According to the UN's latest progress report, 89% of the world's people now have access to electricity, up from 83% in 2010. The vast majority of those gains have come in Asia, where access increased from 87% to 96% over that period. In sub-Saharan Africa, just 48% of people have electricity, although that share is rising quickly from 35% in 2010. Providing the remaining 650 million Africans with power remains a stubborn challenge.

Most of the world's progress in electrification has come from expanding grids, building power lines into remote and rural communities. But for the poorest and most isolated populations, extending the grid is often not feasible. Off-grid solutions like solar panels and microgrids have become increasingly affordable and efficient. The cost of solar panels has fallen over 80% since 2010 while improvements in batteries and LED lights have made small-scale renewable systems practical for many households and communities. 

The transition to cleaner energy sources is vital to mitigate climate change, the gravest long-term threat facing humanity. Under current policies, the world is set to fall short of the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C. Accelerating the rollout of renewable energy and transitioning away from fossil fuels is critical to closing the gap. Here, progress on SDG 7 has been more sluggish. While renewable energy accounted for a quarter of total power generation in 2018, most of that came from hydropower. Solar and wind, the fastest-growing sources, made up just 8% of the mix. Coal still generates 38% of the world's electricity.

Continued progress on SDG 7 will require increasing investments...

[The response continues with several more paragraphs on financing needs, policy priorities, and calls to action to achieve SDG 7.]


 Here is a draft of a long-form article in the style of Harvard Business Review on Sustainable Development Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy:

The Business Case for Investing in Sustainable Energy 

Energy is the lifeblood of the global economy, enabling all sectors of society to function and prosper. However, our current global energy system is unsustainable. It relies heavily on fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas that pollute the environment, harm public health, and contribute to climate change. Transitioning to affordable, reliable and renewable energy for all is crucial for sustainable development.

Sustainable Development Goal 7 calls for member states to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all". This goal aims to provide universal access to energy, increase the share of renewable energy in the global mix, and double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency—all by 2030. Progress on SDG 7 will be essential to mitigate and adapt to climate change and transition to more sustainable economies and societies.

The good news is that renewable energy sources like solar, wind and hydro power have become more affordable and accessible in recent years. The cost of solar panels and wind turbines has declined dramatically. New business models are spreading the use of rooftop solar panels and microgrids. Battery storage technology is enabling the integration of more renewable energy into the grid. These trends are accelerating the transition to clean energy worldwide.

However, major challenges remain to achieve universal access to affordable and clean energy by 2030. There are significant gaps in energy access between urban and rural populations in developing countries. Fossil fuel subsidies remain high, amounting to over $300 billion per year. Energy efficiency initiatives need greater investment and adoption. And energy systems need to be updated to accommodate renewable energy at scale. 

Closing these gaps will require coordinated action across governments, businesses and individuals. Governments should eliminate fossil fuel subsidies, increase investments in renewable energy and grid modernization, and implement supportive policies and targets. Businesses should source more renewable energy, adopt sustainable practices, and invest in clean energy startups and projects. Individuals should reduce energy usage, switch to renewable providers where possible, and support companies taking action on sustainable energy.

With increased commitment and collaboration, a sustainable energy transition is within our reach. Achieving SDG 7 will advance multiple other SDGs, improve public health, create new economic opportunities, and help ensure an inhabitable planet for future generations. The business case is clear: renewable, affordable and clean energy for all is indispensable for a sustainable 21st century economy. By taking ambitious action today, we can achieve this vision within our lifetimes. But we must act now.

Powering the Future: Can the World Achieve SDG 7?

By the Assistant

Energy is the lifeblood of human society, powering our homes, businesses, transportation, and technologies. But today, more than 1 billion around the world still lack access to electricity. And most of the world still relies on fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas that pollute the environment and contribute to climate change. 

Sustainable Development Goal 7 calls for affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030. It's one of the most crucial goals, as access to clean and affordable energy is essential for reducing poverty, improving health and education, and promoting economic growth. But achieving SDG 7 will require a massive shift to renewable energy and a huge increase in investments and political commitments around the world.

According to the UN, since 2010, the number of people without access to electricity has declined by only about 1% per year. At this rate, 600 million will still lack access in 2030. Renewable energy usage has grown, but still only makes up around 17% of total final energy consumption. The UN warns that progress needs to accelerate by a factor of 7 to achieve universal access to renewable energy by 2030.

The good news is that renewable energy is increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels. The cost of solar panels and wind turbines has plummeted by over 80% since 2010. The International Renewable Energy Agency found that by 2020, all renewable power generation technologies will be cost-competitive with fossil fuels. Private companies and investors are increasingly driving the transition to renewables. But governments still need to implement policies to incentivize the switch to renewables while phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and policies that negatively impact the environment.

The Quest for Universal Clean Energy Access: Where We Stand on SDG 7  

By Your AI Assistant

Access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy is one of the greatest challenges facing our world today. Sustainable Development Goal 7 aims to “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all” by 2030. This ambitious goal requires huge investments in renewable energy and a massive expansion of energy access to the poorest and most remote communities on the planet. 

According to the UN's latest SDG progress report, we have made some progress but not fast enough. The good news is that renewable energy use continues to rise rapidly worldwide. Solar and wind power are now cost competitive with fossil fuels in many markets, driving record growth in renewable installations. Over the last decade, the average cost of solar panels has declined by over 80% and the cost of wind turbines has declined by 30-40%. This has spurred significant investments in renewables, with over $250 billion in investments in 2017 alone.

However, despite these gains, 13% of the world's population still lacks access to electricity and 42% rely primarily on polluting and unhealthy cooking fuels like coal and wood. The UN warns that the world is not on track to achieve universal energy access by 2030 at current rates of progress. Rural and disadvantaged communities remain heavily underserved, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia and the Pacific.  

To achieve SDG 7, the world must redouble its efforts to expand energy access through investments in distributed renewable energy and energy efficiency. The private sector has an important role to play through innovative business models that can reach the world's poorest communities in a scalable way. Partnerships between companies, governments and international organizations will be key. The UN's Sustainable Energy for All initiative is one example of a platform bringing together key stakeholders to accelerate progress on energy access, renewable energy and energy efficiency.

With only 10 years left to achieve the SDGs, the coming decade will be critical. But with continued technological improvements, falling costs and innovative new models for delivering energy services, achieving universal clean energy access is within our reach. Success will require political will, partnerships, and ensuring no community is left behind in the transition to sustainable energy for all. Overall we have a long way to go, but progress on SDG 7 can and must be accelerated to build a cleaner energy future for people and planet alike.

The Global Challenge of Achieving SDG 7: Access to Affordable, Reliable, and Sustainable Energy for All 

Energy is the lifeblood of modern society, powering economies and raising living standards around the world. However, according to the UN, nearly 1 billion people still lack access to electricity. Many more suffer from unreliable or unaffordable energy services. At the same time, the current energy system still relies heavily on fossil fuels, contributing significantly to climate change. 

In 2015, the world adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 7 aims to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all." Specifically, the targets under SDG 7 aim to substantially increase the share of renewable energy in the global mix, double the rate of improvement in energy efficiency, and expand infrastructure and upgrade technology to supply modern and sustainable energy services to all developing countries.

Progress on SDG 7 is mixed. According to the latest UN progress report, the share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption grew modestly from 16.6% in 2010 to only 17.1% in 2017. While renewable energy uptake and investments have accelerated in some sectors like solar and wind power, renewable energy use in heating and transport remains limited. Improvements in energy efficiency, especially in the transportation and building sectors, have also been slow and uneven across regions. 

On the other hand, the number of people gaining access to electricity in developing countries has increased significantly, from 83% of the global population in 2010 to 87% in 2017. However, despite accelerated connections in some of the least developed countries, the absolute number of people without electricity has remained unchanged at around 840 million, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Many newly connected populations also remain vulnerable to unreliable or unaffordable supply. 

Achieving SDG 7 will require a massive international effort to transition the energy sector toward affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy for all. Developing countries need increased investments and financing in renewable energy projects, grid infrastructure, and energy efficiency upgrades. Partnerships between governments, international organizations, businesses, and civil society can help mobilize action, expertise, and resources. Urgent action is needed to ensure no one is left behind in the global shift to sustainable energy for all.


 Here is a draft of an academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all) in the style of the Journal of International Development:

Sustainable Development Goal 7: A Critical Review of Progress and Challenges 

Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the world faces today. Be it for jobs, security, climate change, food production or increasing incomes, access to energy for all is essential. Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) aims to “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all” by 2030. This ambitious goal requires increasing substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, and doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. Achieving SDG 7 can help advance many other sustainable development goals by enabling the delivery of critical services like healthcare and education, and facilitating sustainable economic growth. 

Progress towards SDG 7 has been uneven across regions. Significant strides have been made in improving access to electricity in developing regions of the world, increasing to 89% in 2018 from 83% in 2010 globally. However, 840 million people still do not have access to electricity and 3 billion lack access to clean cooking fuels and technologies. The rate of expansion of renewables has been remarkable, supplying 18.1% of global total final energy consumption in 2017, although much faster change is needed. Improvements in energy efficiency have been more modest. To achieve SDG 7, annual investments in energy efficiency and renewables must more than double.
 
The major challenges to achieving SDG 7 are lack of access to energy, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia; underinvestment in clean energy and energy efficiency technologies; insufficient policy and regulatory frameworks to support renewable energy growth; and lack of coordination between actors. According to the UN Secretary-General's latest SDG progress report, greater cooperation at the global and regional level is urgently needed to achieve SDG 7, including collaboration on technology, innovation and investments in clean energy infrastructure across borders.

In conclusion, accelerated action and urgency are needed to achieve universal access to affordable and reliable energy by 2030 in line with SDG 7. Doing so would have positive ripple effects across the entire 2030 Agenda. Success will require massive investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency, strong policy support, collaboration between governments and private sector actors, and a relentless focus on leaving no one behind. Achieving SDG 7 can catalyze the transition to an equitable clean energy future for all.

Achieving Universal Access to Affordable, Reliable, Sustainable and Modern Energy for All: Progress and Challenges Toward Sustainable Development Goal 7

Abstract: Sustainable Development Goal 7 aims to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all" by 2030. This includes targets for increasing renewable energy, doubling the rate of energy efficiency and access to electricity, and expanding access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking. This paper analyzes the progress made toward SDG 7 targets to date, based on the latest data and reports from the UN and partner agencies. While there has been substantial progress on some fronts, accelerated action is needed to achieve the goal, especially for the poorest and most vulnerable populations currently lacking access to basic energy services. With only 10 years left to achieve the SDG targets, this paper examines the challenges that remain and provides policy recommendations to help ensure affordable and clean energy access for all.  

Progress on Increasing Access to Electricity and Clean Cooking Fuels 
Access to energy is essential for development and poverty reduction. According to Sustainable Energy for All, 1.1 billion people still lack access to electricity and 2.8 billion lack access to clean fuels for cooking (SEforALL 2018). The UN Secretary-General's SDG report notes that the number of people without access to electricity declined from 1.2 billion in 2010 to 840 million in 2016 (UN 2019). The rate of new connections has accelerated, especially in Asia, but needs to double to achieve universal access. Access to clean cooking fuels also improved, but at a slower rate, leaving many still exposed to dangerous pollutants.  

Progress on Increasing the Share of Renewable Energy 
Under SDG target 7.2, countries pledged to increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. The share of renewables grew from 16.6% in 2010 to 17.5% in 2016, largely due to investments in solar and wind energy (REN21 2018). Hydropower still provides the bulk of renewable energy, but growth has slowed. While the transition to renewable energy is underway in many developed countries, the UN notes the need for emerging economies to intensify the uptake of renewable energy to meet SDG 7 (UN 2019). At the current pace, the renewable energy share will reach only 21% by 2030, short of the goal. Accelerated policy action and partnerships are needed.

The Critical Role of Energy in Achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda 

Access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy is central to achieving sustainable development and improving human well-being.  Sustainable Development Goal 7 aims to “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all” by 2030 through expanding renewable energy and improving energy efficiency. Achieving SDG 7 is key to progress across multiple other SDGs including SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). 

According to analysis by the UN Secretariat, 1.3 billion people today still lack access to electricity and around 3 billion people rely on traditional biomass for cooking and heating. Energy poverty disproportionately impacts those in rural areas, and households headed by women. Lack of access to modern energy services hinders opportunities for education, employment and economic growth. Furthermore, heavy reliance on traditional biomass and inefficient stoves has detrimental impacts on health, environment and social development. Providing universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy is crucial for inclusive growth, empowerment of marginalized groups and sustainable livelihoods.

In recent years, the costs of key renewable energy technologies like solar and wind have declined dramatically, offering affordable and sustainable energy options. However, renewable energy investment and deployment needs to accelerate significantly to achieve SDG 7 targets and the goals of the Paris Agreement. Mobilizing finance from public and private sectors will be key to deploying renewable energy solutions at the required scale. Innovative policies, partnerships and business models are also needed to provide sustainable energy access for the most vulnerable and hardest to reach populations.  

Progress on SDG 7 needs to be closely monitored through improved data collection and analysis. The UN’s annual SDG progress report finds that while access to electricity continues to expand globally, clean cooking solutions and renewable energy expansion are not on track to meet targets. Additional efforts will be required to improve access to high-quality, timely and disaggregated data to strengthen analysis on who is being left behind and guide policy interventions. Partnerships across UN agencies, multilateral development banks, private sector and civil society will be instrumental for sharing knowledge, channeling investment and accelerating momentum to achieve universal access to energy by 2030.

In conclusion, SDG 7 is central to sustainable development and improving well-being for all. Urgent action is needed to provide universal access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy through renewable energy expansion, energy efficiency and innovative policies and finance. Success will require coordinated global efforts across sectors to ensure no one is left behind in the transition to modern energy access. Achieving SDG 7 can help drive progress across the entire 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

SDG 7: Ensuring Access to Affordable, Reliable, Sustainable and Modern Energy for All

Access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy is crucial for human well-being and economic development. Sustainable Development Goal 7 aims to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all" by 2030. This goal includes targets for increasing the share of renewable energy, doubling the rate of energy efficiency and universal access to affordable energy services.

Progress on SDG 7 is monitored by six indicators that track access to electricity, access to clean fuels and technologies, renewable energy share, energy intensity, international financial flows for clean energy research and development, and investments in energy efficiency. According to the UN Secretary-General's 2019 SDG report, encouraging progress has been made on some of these indicators in recent years, though still not at the rate needed to achieve the goal by 2030. For example, the share of renewable energy (excluding hydroelectricity) in total final energy consumption increased modestly from 7.6% to 9.6% between 2011 to 2016, while the global rate of primary energy intensity improvement accelerated from 2.0% to 2.7% between 2012 and 2017. However, more than 800 million people still lacked access to electricity as of 2017. 

Achieving SDG 7 will require significant investments in renewable energy infrastructure, energy efficiency and expanded energy access. The UN estimates additional global investments of $29 to $36 billion per year in renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy access will be needed to achieve SDG 7. Major sources of financing will need to come from private sector investments and development aid flows. Multilateral development banks like the World Bank also play an important role in financing energy projects aligned with SDG 7. But increased investments alone are not enough. Supportive public policy, pricing reforms, technology innovation and scaled-up renewable energy deployment are also essential to facilitating a transition to affordable and sustainable energy for all.

Overall, progress on SDG 7 has been mixed but more ambitious action is urgently needed to achieve universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy by 2030. Financing the energy transition will require unlocking both private and public sector resources. With enhanced efforts and multi-stakeholder cooperation focused on enabling policies, technological innovation and project implementation, achieving SDG 7 can move from vision to reality. But the next decade is critical, as the world races against the 2030 deadline. Urgent action needs to be taken to provide sustainable energy for billions in need.


 Here is a draft academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the World Development journal:

Achieving Universal Access to Affordable, Reliable, and Modern Energy under SDG 7  

Sustainable Development Goal 7 aims to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all" by 2030. This goal encompasses targets around improving energy access, increasing the share of renewable energy, and improving energy efficiency and access to clean energy technology. Progress on SDG 7 is critical to achieving sustainable development and improved well-being worldwide.

Expanding Energy Access 
Despite progress in recent decades, 840 million people still lack access to electricity and 3 billion people rely on inefficient and polluting cooking systems, like burning wood or coal. The UN Secretary-General's 2020 SDG Progress Report found that the rate of electrification needs to double to meet the 2030 goal. Target 7.1 focuses on universal access, with indicators tracking the proportion of the population with access to electricity and clean fuels and technology for cooking. To increase energy access, many UN organizations recommend policies like infrastructure investment, public-private partnerships, and renewable energy expansion, especially for rural and disadvantaged areas.  

Increasing the Share of Renewable Energy
Transitioning to renewable energy is critical for climate change mitigation, energy security, and lower pollution. Target 7.2 aims to increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. According to recent IEA estimates, renewable energy grew at its fastest rate in four years in 2019, accounting for almost 75% of new power generation. However, the share of renewables in total final energy consumption grew only modestly from 17.3% in 2018 to 17.5% in 2019, showing more work is needed. The UN and World Bank recommend renewable energy policies like feed-in tariffs, renewable energy certifications, and partnerships with private companies to spur faster transitions to solar, wind and other renewable energy.  

Improving Energy Efficiency 
Improving energy efficiency can reduce energy consumption, decrease pollution, and lessen the environmental impacts of energy production. Target 7.3 focuses on improving energy efficiency. According to UN DESA, global primary energy intensity declined by less than 1% from 2018 to 2019, far below the annual 3% decline needed to achieve the target. Suggested policies include adopting energy efficiency standards for buildings and vehicles, providing incentives for efficiency improvements in industry and transportation, and raising public awareness about efficiency and conservation.

In summary, progress on SDG 7 requires a coordinated global effort to expand energy access, transition to renewable energy, and improve efficiency. Policies, partnerships, and new technologies are all needed to achieve the ambitious goal of clean, affordable energy for all by 2030 and unlock the potential of sustainable development. Overall, while there has been progress, accelerated and collaborative actions must be taken to accomplish the energy transformation envisioned in SDG 7.


 Here is a draft of an academic article in the style of the World Bank Economic Review on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7):

Progress and Challenges Towards Sustainable Energy for All: An Analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 7   

Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) aims to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all" by 2030. This goal encompasses targets related to access to electricity and clean fuels for cooking, the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, improvements in energy efficiency, and research and development in clean energy technologies. Significant progress has been made on SDG 7 in recent years, with rapid declines in the costs of key renewable energy technologies like solar and wind power, widespread adoption of new policies incentivizing renewables and energy efficiency, and increased financing for energy access and clean energy projects. However, major challenges remain to achieve universal access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy.   

According to the latest SDG progress report from the UN Secretary-General, the number of people without access to electricity dropped to below 1 billion in 2018, down from 1.2 billion in 2010. The majority of people gaining access live in rural areas of the developing world. However, despite this progress, 6 percent of the world’s population remains without access to electricity and populations lacking access are increasingly in more remote, poor and vulnerable communities. Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking has also improved, but more slowy, reaching 61 percent of the global population in 2017 up from 56% in 2010. Close to 3 billion people remain without access to clean cooking fuels and technologies and are exposed to dangerous levels of air pollution.  

To meet the renewable energy and energy efficiency targets of SDG 7, the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix must increase substantially while energy intensity continues declining. Renewable energy made up 17.5% of total final energy consumption (TFEC) in 2016, up only modestly from 16.6% in 2010 according to IRENA. Hydropower remains the largest source, comprising around two-thirds of renewable energy in TFEC, followed by bioenergy, wind and solar. Solar and wind energy have grown rapidly, though from a small base. Energy intensity, meanwhile, improved by around 1.3% annually from 2010 to 2016, slower than the goal of 2.6% per year needed to meet SDG 7. Significant scale-up of renewable energy investments, policy implementation and technology diffusion will be needed to accelerate progress.

Sustainable Development Goal 7 aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030. This goal is focused on expanding access to clean and renewable energy as well as improving energy efficiency. According to the UN, around 1 billion people still lack access to electricity and clean cooking fuels and technologies. The majority of those people live in rural areas of developing countries. Access to affordable and reliable energy services is essential for reducing poverty and improving health, increasing productivity, and creating new economic opportunities.  

Progress on SDG 7 requires increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency and enhance international cooperation. Doubling the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix is critical to transitioning the world to a low carbon economy and limiting global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius. The global renewable energy share has been increasing over time but needs to accelerate to meet the SDG 7 target. In 2018, 17.5% of total final energy consumption came from renewable sources. Renewable energy sources include solar, wind, hydro and geothermal.  

Improving energy efficiency and reducing energy intensity is key to achieving SDG 7. The rate of primary energy intensity improvement needs to double to meet the goal. Primary energy intensity is a measure of the amount of energy used to generate one unit of GDP. Reducing energy intensity reduces energy demand and decreases carbon emissions. According to the IEA, global primary energy intensity improved by 1.2% in 2018 but needs to accelerate to 2.6% per year to achieve SDG 7. Significant energy efficiency gains can be made across all sectors including in buildings, transportation and industry.  

International cooperation on technology, finance and policy is essential for progress on affordable and clean energy. Developed countries need to provide financial and technical support to developing countries to expand renewable energy and improve energy efficiency. Partnerships between governments, the private sector and civil society can help mobilize investment in renewable energy and scale up energy access programs. Cooperation on technology and innovation is also needed to drive down the cost of renewable energy and make sustainable energy options more affordable and accessible for developing countries.

In summary, SDG 7 aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030 through increasing the share of renewable energy, improving energy efficiency and enhancing international cooperation. Significant progress has been made but accelerated action is needed across all areas to achieve this critical goal and ensure sustainable energy for all.


 Here is a draft speech by the UN Secretary-General on SDG 7:

UN SG Speech 

My fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen, 

We have gathered here today to discuss progress on Sustainable Development Goal 7 - access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. This goal lies at the very heart of the 2030 Agenda. Access to energy is crucial for achieving almost all of the Sustainable Development Goals. It is essential for powering homes, businesses and transportation. It enables children to study after dark, powers medical facilities, and fuels economic growth and job creation.

Despite this central importance, one in five people still lack access to electricity. And more than 2.8 billion people still rely on wood, coal, charcoal or animal waste to cook their food and heat their homes, exposing themselves and their families to dangerous levels of indoor air pollution. Existing inequalities in energy access negatively impact inclusive and sustainable growth, especially for women and marginalized groups. Urgent action is needed to change this.

Some progress has been made. The number of people without access to electricity declined from 1.2 billion in 2010 to 1 billion in 2016. Many countries have implemented policies, plans and targets to increase the use of renewable energy and improve energy efficiency. The share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption reached 17.5% in 2015. However, the pace of progress needs to accelerate dramatically to achieve universal access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy by 2030.  

To accelerate progress, I call on all countries to:

-Make access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy a priority, and accelerate deployment of renewable energy and improvement in energy efficiency. Targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency must be more ambitious. 

-Increase public and private investments in the energy sector. Mobilize domestic and international finance from private and public sources to fund energy access and clean energy projects. Establish enabling policy frameworks to catalyze private sector investments.

-Leave no one behind. Ensure affordable access to energy for the poor and most vulnerable. Design policies targeting women, youth, and marginalized groups. Harness decentralized renewable energy solutions for remote and rural areas.

-Foster regional cooperation on energy issues. Promote cross-border trade of renewable energy and development of regional energy infrastructure and markets. Share good practices and experiences.

With bold action and cooperation from all partners, I believe we can achieve SDG 7 and provide sustainable energy for all by 2030. The time for action is now. Our planet's future is at stake. Together, let us light up and power the world.

Thank you.


 UN USG Speech  

Distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, 

It is an honor to address you today on the critical topic of Sustainable Development Goal 7 - access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. As Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States, advancing SDG7 is central to my mandate.

Despite progress in recent years, billions of people still lack access to electricity and clean cooking fuels. According to the latest SDG7 Tracking Report from the UN Statistics Division, 759 million people still have no access to electricity. And a staggering 3 billion people still cook using polluting fuels like coal, wood, and kerosene. Access to energy is fundamental to achieving many other SDGs and improving lives and livelihoods around the world. 

The impacts of energy poverty are severe. Lack of access to electricity makes it difficult to pump water, power hospitals, and improve sanitation. Reliance on polluting fuels for cooking has devastating health effects, especially for women and children, causing millions of premature deaths each year from household air pollution. The use of kerosene lamps also causes injuries and fires, and limits the hours of safe and productive activity. 

The good news is we have the technologies and knowledge to solve this problem. Renewable energy solutions like solar, wind and hydro power have become more affordable and accessible. Decentralized renewable energy systems can now provide access even in remote areas. New financing models and public-private partnerships are helping energy projects get off the ground in developing countries. 

However, much more needs to be done. Governments must make access to sustainable energy a higher priority, integrating it into national development plans and policies. They must establish regulatory frameworks that facilitate private investment in clean energy. And they must invest in the infrastructure and human capital needed to scale up sustainable energy solutions.  

Development partners and donors should support these efforts by honoring their aid commitments, directing more funds to energy access, and helping developing countries maximize the potential of tools like the Green Climate Fund. Businesses should continue innovating and reducing costs, and find profitable ways to serve poor and remote communities.  

With political will, investments and partnerships, we can achieve SDG7 and deliver sustainable energy for all. But we must act now. Every day of delay means more lives lost, more livelihoods stunted, and more of our planet degraded. I urge you all to renew your commitment to this goal, and work together to build a more just, equitable and sustainable future for people and the planet.

Thank you.


 Political speech 

My fellow citizens, 

We live in a time of great progress, but also great peril. While humanity has achieved remarkable advancements in science, technology, and standards of living, we now face existential threats from climate change, environmental degradation, and economic inequality. That is why today I want to speak about Sustainable Development Goal 7 - affordable and clean energy, and how it can help transition us to a sustainable future for all.

SDG 7 calls for universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services by 2030. This is crucial, because energy is the golden thread that runs through all aspects of development. Access to sustainable energy can drive economic growth, increase productivity, enhance health and education outcomes, and improve agricultural yields. At the same time, our current energy systems contribute around 60% of greenhouse gas emissions. We must transition rapidly to renewable energy and make significant improvements in energy efficiency. 

According to reports by the UN and International Energy Agency, we are making progress but not fast enough. The share of renewable energy is increasing, but over 800 million people still lack access to electricity. There are massive inequalities in energy access between urban and rural populations in many parts of the world. New policies, increased financing, and innovative partnerships are urgently needed. I propose we set a target for our country to reach 50% renewable energy in the next decade, through investments in solar, wind and geothermal power. Let's also prioritize bringing electricity access to remote and underserved communities. 

Affordable and clean energy is one of the smartest investments we can make in our shared future. It will improve lives, protect the planet, and drive sustainable economic growth. But we must act now. The science is clear, and the vulnerability of our energy systems in the face of climate change is evident. Together, through cooperation and innovation, we can achieve SDG 7 and build a sustainable energy system that powers opportunity for all. Our children and grandchildren deserve nothing less. This is the challenge of our generation. Together, let's rise up and meet it!


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of a UN DESA report:

Sustainable Development Goal 7: Progress and Challenges in Achieving Affordable and Clean Energy for All  

Executive Summary: This report provides an in-depth review of the global progress made towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. It analyzes trends in expanding access to electricity and clean cooking fuels and technologies, increasing the share of renewable energy and improving energy efficiency. While there has been steady progress in increasing access to electricity and renewable energy, the world is not on track to achieve SDG 7 targets by 2030. Accelerated action is urgently needed to extend affordable and clean energy access to all households, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency and increase the share of renewable energy. Significant investments, policy changes and new partnerships will be required across all sectors and regions to achieve SDG 7.   

Access to electricity: As of 2019, around 860 million people still live without electricity and progress has plateaued since 2014. Access to electricity is slowing in Sub-Saharan Africa, offsetting gains in other regions. Under current trends, around 620 million people will remain without access in 2030, short of the SDG 7 target. To achieve universal access, an annual investment of $35 to $40 billion per year is needed, mainly for grid extension and off-grid solar systems in rural areas. Policy and regulatory reforms are also needed to address affordability, increase private sector participation, and improve utility performance.  

Access to clean cooking: Despite efforts to promote cleaner cooking fuels and stoves, around 2.8 billion people still do not have access to clean cooking solutions and continue using polluting and unhealthy fuels like coal, charcoal and firewood. The transition to cleaner cooking has been slow due to affordability, supply chain and policy challenges. Urgent action is needed to scale up access to liquefied petroleum gas, biogas, solar-powered stoves and electric cooking to meet the 2030 target. This will require investments of $4.4 billion per year along with lowering costs, strengthening supply chains and raising consumer awareness about the benefits of clean cooking.  

Share of renewable energy: The share of renewable energy in the total final energy consumption has increased steadily, reaching 17.5% in 2017. However, the pace of increase needs to double to achieve the goal of 36% renewable energy by 2030. Growth has been uneven across regions, with faster progress in electricity compared to transport and heating. Policy support, grid integration investments, access to finance and technological improvements are critical to scale up renewable energy, especially solar, wind and bioenergy in all end-use sectors.   

Energy efficiency: Global primary energy intensity (energy per unit of GDP) improved by an average of 2.2% per year from 2015 to 2017. However, this rate needs to double to meet the SDG 7 target. Improving energy efficiency across all sectors - buildings, transport, appliances - can significantly reduce energy demand while supporting economic growth. Accelerating energy efficiency will require implementing and enforcing standards and policies, investing in new technologies, changing consumer behavior and transitioning to sustainable mobility systems.

[The report will continue with additional details on challenges, policy recommendations and conclusions]


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) - Affordable and Clean Energy, in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA):

Progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy  

Access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy is crucial for economic growth and improving living standards around the world. SDG 7 aims to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services, increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, and double the rate of improvement in energy efficiency - all by 2030. According to the latest data, the world is not on track to achieve SDG 7. Significant acceleration is urgently needed to provide clean and affordable energy for all.

Global access to electricity and clean cooking fuels increased slightly in 2019 but remains far from the goal of universal access. According to estimates from the International Energy Agency, 759 million people still lack access to electricity and 2.6 billion people lack access to clean cooking fuels and technologies. The majority of those without access are located in sub-Saharan Africa. While electrification is improving in most regions of the world, the population growth outpaces the speed of progress. Without urgent action, 650 million will still lack access in 2030.  

The share of renewable energy in the total final energy consumption reached 17.3% in 2017, continuing a steady increase over the past decade. However, the rate of increase needs to double to meet the SDG 7 target. Renewables accounted for more than half of the increase in global power generating capacity in 2019, with solar and wind leading the growth. To accelerate the transition, it is crucial to scale up investments in renewable energy infrastructure, provide policy incentives and market reforms, and mainstream renewable energy in end-use sectors like transport and heating.

Global primary energy intensity - the amount of energy used per unit of GDP - improved by 1.3% in 2019 but remains well below the annual rate needed to achieve the SDG 7 target. Accelerating energy efficiency improvements depends on policy and market reforms, adoption of new technologies, green building codes, and increasing investments in efficiency upgrades across all sectors of the economy.

[The report would continue with several more paragraphs discussing challenges, regional differences, and recommendations to accelerate progress towards achieving SDG 7 based on analysis from UN DESA and other UN sources].


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), Division for Public Institutions and Digital Government (DPIDG):

Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all 

Progress on SDG 7 has been uneven across regions and countries. While access to electricity has improved globally, access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking and heating remains a challenge. Investments in renewable energy are increasing, but not at the pace needed to achieve the targets by 2030. 

Access to affordable and reliable energy is crucial for achieving many of the SDGs, including those related to poverty eradication, health, education, and economic opportunity. However, there were still 840 million people without access to electricity in 2017, mainly concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia. The population without access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking reached 3 billion in 2017. Household air pollution from the use of solid fuels for cooking and heating contributes to over 4 million deaths per year from non-communicable diseases and lower respiratory infections.

On the positive side, the renewable energy share of total final energy consumption increased moderately from 16.6% in 2010 to 17.5% in 2016. However, the annual rate of increase needs to accelerate to achieve the target of substantially increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030. Global investments in renewable energy increased from $288.6 billion in 2017 to $288.9 billion in 2018, reversing a downward trend but still falling short of the investment needed. Hydropower still provides the largest share of renewable energy, although solar and wind energy have seen rapid growth recently.

Regionally, progress on SDG 7 targets has been most significant in Europe and North America, as well as in parts of Asia. Latin America and the Caribbean, Northern Africa and Western Asia have also seen good progress. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to lag, with an electricity access rate of only 43% in 2017 and a very low share of renewable energy. Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking has increased at a slower pace globally.

 Here is a draft long-form analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (Division for Sustainable Development Goals):

Sustainable Development Goal 7: Progress and Challenges in Providing Affordable and Clean Energy for All 

Access to affordable, reliable, and clean energy is essential for sustainable development and poverty reduction. Sustainable Development Goal 7 aims to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all" by 2030. This goal includes targets for increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency, and ensuring universal access to affordable energy services. 

According to the UN Secretary-General's 2019 SDG report, progress on SDG 7 remains slow and uneven across regions. An estimated 840 million people still lack access to electricity, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa, and clean cooking fuels and technologies are inaccessible for nearly 3 billion people worldwide. Energy intensity continues to decline globally, but efficiency and renewable energy efforts need to accelerate significantly to achieve Goal 7. 

On the renewable energy front, the share of renewables in the global energy mix reached 17.5% in 2017, but annual growth must quadruple to achieve the 2030 target. Solar and wind power have seen rapid growth, but hydropower remains the largest source of renewable energy. Developing countries have shown leadership in building solar energy infrastructure, but challenges remain in upgrading power systems and mobilizing the investments needed for large-scale adoption of renewable energy.  

On energy efficiency, global primary energy intensity improved by 1.7% in 2017 - short of the 3% annual target. Energy efficiency improvements have slowed in recent years, indicating that a renewed commitment to energy conservation and reduced waste is urgently needed in transportation, buildings, and industrial sectors. In many countries, lack of information, limited access to technology and financing, misaligned policies and incentives have thwarted more rapid progress.

Providing universal access to affordable and clean energy requires closing the vast gaps that remain in access to basic energy services. About 87% of the global population now has access to electricity, but vast inequalities persist across regions. Access to clean cooking remains an enormous challenge, as 2.8 billion people still rely on inefficient and unhealthy wood, coal, and kerosene stoves. Closing these access gaps will require increased investments in renewable and decentralized energy options together with stronger governance, education, and policy frameworks that can mobilize action.

In summary, while some encouraging progress has been made towards Goal 7, accelerated and coordinated global action is urgently needed to shift countries onto a path towards sustainable energy for all. Achieving this goal will require rapid transitions to renewable energy and scaled up improvements in energy efficiency, as well as innovative policies and funding models to provide affordable and clean energy access for the poorest and most vulnerable populations. With the world significantly off-track from achieving Goal 7, renewed political will and more substantial policy, regulatory and financial commitments will be essential over the coming decade.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on SDG 7 (Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all) in the style of the UN DESA's Division for Sustainable Development Goals:

SDG 7 seeks to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030. Access to modern energy services is fundamental to the functioning of any prosperous society. With greater availability and use of energy services, countries can strengthen their energy security, expand industrialization, improve agriculture and promote the well-being of their people. Progress on SDG 7 will also contribute significantly towards the achievement of other goals, such as improving health and education, providing clean water and sanitation, enhancing employment and economic growth, and achieving sustainable urbanization.  

According to the latest SDG progress report, while some progress has been made, more accelerated action is urgently needed to achieve this goal. About 840 million people in the world still have no access to electricity. Access rates remain particularly low in Sub-Saharan Africa and developing countries in Asia. The rate of progress needs to quadruple to achieve universal access to electricity by 2030. At the current pace of progress, 674 million people will still lack access in 2030. Even when people gain access, the reliability and affordability of electricity services remain major challenges in developing countries. 

Modernizing energy infrastructures and deploying renewable energy on a large scale is key to progress. Significant energy efficiency improvements are urgently needed in buildings, transportation and industry. The share of renewable energy in the total final energy consumption grew modestly, from 16.3% in 2010 to 16.9% in 2015. But the rate of growth needs to accelerate to meet the ambitious goal of substantially increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030. Greater investments are needed in renewable energy infrastructure, as well as promoting renewable energy industries. 

Regional differences in progress highlight the need for targeted interventions...[Additional analysis and details on key indicators, challenges and recommendations for different regions: Africa, Asia, Latin America, etc.]

In summary, achieving SDG 7 will require substantial policy, technology and investment shifts at the global and national levels to modernize energy systems and promote renewable energy industries. Strong political commitment and partnerships at all levels will be essential to affordable and clean energy for all. With only 10 years left to achieve the SDGs, urgent action is needed to accelerate progress on SDG 7.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (Division for Sustainable Development Goals):

Progress on Sustainable Development Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

Access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services is crucial for achieving the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals. Energy is essential for powering economies, infrastructure, manufacturing, and transportation systems across the world. However, nearly 1 billion people still lack access to electricity and 3 billion people rely on polluting solid fuels for cooking and heating. Achieving universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy by 2030 as targeted in SDG 7 is imperative to progress on poverty eradication, improved health and education, clean water and sanitation, sustainable cities, and other development priorities. 

According to the latest data in the Secretary-General’s SDG progress report, the global primary energy intensity improvement rate is 2.3% per year, which needs to accelerate to meet the SDG 7 target rate of 2.7-3.4% per year. Improvements in energy efficiency have slowed in recent years. While renewable energy is making encouraging progress, accounting for 18.2% of total final energy consumption in 2017, the annual growth rate of 4.3% needs to speed up to meet the SDG target of substantially increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. 

Globally, 85.3% of the population has access to electricity, an improvement of 0.71% per year since 2010. However, at the current rate of progress, 620 million people would still lack access in 2030, far short of the universal access target. Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking reached 61.7% in 2017, improving 0.81% per year. But without accelerated progress, 22% of the population would remain without access to clean cooking in 2030. There are vast inequalities in energy access between and within countries based on income level, urban/rural location and other factors. 

To achieve SDG 7, the international community must urgently scale up action. Countries need to adopt integrated policy approaches to decarbonize energy systems, including implementing the Paris Agreement commitments. Investing in renewable energy, energy efficiency improvements and decentralized sustainable energy solutions at scale is critical. New partnerships between governments, the private sector and civil society can mobilize finance and accelerate the transition to sustainable energy for all. Achieving SDG 7 will be crucial to build a sustainable future for people and planet. Overall, while there has been some progress on SDG 7, accelerated action is urgently needed to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of UNDP:

Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all

Energy is central to achieving almost all the Sustainable Development Goals and targets. It powers economies and livelihoods, and provides essential services including water, healthcare and education. However, billions of people live without electricity and rely on poor and hazardous fuel sources for cooking and heating. Roughly 675 million people still lack access to clean cooking facilities and energy, resulting in millions of deaths each year from respiratory diseases and other illnesses related to indoor pollution. Urgent action is needed to transition to more sustainable energy systems and provide universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services.  

Progress on SDG 7 has been uneven. Significant strides have been made in improving energy efficiency and increasing access to renewable energy and clean cooking fuels and technologies around the world. Almost all countries have set renewable energy targets and nearly all have set energy efficiency standards. However, annual greenhouse gas emissions and carbon intensity are yet to peak, and investment and policies still favor fossil fuels over renewable energy and clean technologies. Poor energy access and use of polluting and inefficient technologies persist in many developing countries. 

As noted in the latest report by the United Nations Secretary-General, delivering universal access to affordable energy by 2030 requires investing in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and thermal. It means transitioning to more efficient and sustainable energy systems, prioritizing energy efficiency and investing in new technologies. It also entails providing targeted support for poor and marginalized groups, and improving data collection and monitoring of progress.

Developing countries in particular need support to expand basic energy infrastructure and to transition to renewable energy and clean cooking solutions. Developed countries can provide financing and technical assistance, and work with developing countries to curb emissions from fossil fuels and build more sustainable energy systems. At the current pace, an estimated 660 million people would still lack access to electricity in 2030, so redoubled efforts are urgently needed to provide universal access to affordable and clean energy.

In conclusion, progress on SDG 7 needs to accelerate through national and international cooperation to scale up renewable energy and make clean and efficient energy accessible and affordable for all. With concerted global action and political will, a sustainable energy future can be within reach. But the window for action is closing fast. Urgent steps must be taken now to change course and deliver on the promise of sustainable energy for all.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the UNCTAD report for an expert audience:

Progress on Achieving Sustainable Energy for All: An Analysis of SDG 7

Access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy is critical for sustainable economic growth and development. It is essential for improving basic human well-being, enhancing productivity and competitivity, and enabling technological and economic progress. However, despite steady progress, 13 percent of the world's population still lack access to modern electricity. And over 3 billion people rely on inefficient and polluting energy sources for cooking and heating. 

The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and SDG 7 on affordable and clean energy offers a renewed opportunity for coordinated global action. According to the latest SDG progress report from the UN Secretary-General, the world has seen some advancement on SDG 7. The proportion of renewable energy in the global energy mix reached 17.5 percent in 2017, electricity access in rural areas reached 83 percent in 2017, and total primary energy supply per capita increased modestly. However, the pace of progress needs to accelerate dramatically to achieve universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030.

On improving access, decentralized renewable energy solutions hold promise for remote rural areas. Public-private partnerships, innovative business models and targeted subsidies are enabling factors. But more financing, especially for the least developed countries, is urgently needed. The recent launch of initiatives like the UN's Sustainable Energy Fund are steps in the right direction. 

On transitioning to renewable energy, declining costs of solar and wind have led to exponential growth in installations. However, renewable energy still makes up only a small fraction of total final energy consumption. Fossil fuels continue to dominate energy systems worldwide due to existing infrastructure, policies, and subsidies. Achieving SDG 7 will require structurally transforming energy policy and redirecting investments to favor renewable energy. It will also need scaling innovative business models that provide sustainable energy as a service.

In conclusion, the world has a long way to go to achieving universal access to sustainable energy under SDG 7. Success will depend on mobilizing political will and action to increase financing, spur renewable energy transitions, and adopt integrated policy and market solutions. The next decade is critical, and the UN system is uniquely positioned to accelerate progress through partnerships, knowledge-sharing and global consensus building. With shared vision and resolve, the promise of SDG 7 can be realized, improving lives and safeguarding the planet.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) targeting an expert audience:

SDG 7: Progress on Affordable and Clean Energy in Africa 

Access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy is crucial for Africa’s development and the wellbeing of its citizens. SDG 7 aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030. According to recent estimates from the International Energy Agency, 600 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa still lack access to electricity and 900 million lack access to clean cooking fuels and technologies, highlighting the scale of the challenge remaining to achieve universal access. Progress on SDG 7 in Africa has been slow and uneven, although there are some bright spots of progress driven by innovation, political will, private sector investment, and development assistance.  

On the electricity access front, positive trends include the use of off-grid renewables, notably solar home systems, to provide basic energy access for households and businesses in remote areas. Companies such as M-KOPA, Lumos and Bboxx have connected millions of customers in East Africa, Nigeria and other countries with small solar systems on a pay-as-you-go model. The rise of mini-grids and renewable energy-powered microgrids is also helping to accelerate access for underserved communities. At the country level, Ethiopia has built a major dam and new high-voltage lines which have connected millions to the grid. Kenya’s Last Mile Connectivity Project aims to achieve universal access by 2022. However, greater political commitment and policy support for decentralized renewable energy solutions is still needed across most African governments to speed the transition to clean energy for all.

The progress on clean cooking access and transitioning to more efficient and sustainable use of biomass and fuels has been slower...[additional details and analysis on other aspects of SDG 7 and energy issues in Africa].  

In conclusion, while parts of Africa have seen innovation and political will driving progress on SDG 7, greater cooperation between governments, donors, the private sector and citizens is urgently needed to overcome the interlinked challenges of affordability, accessibility and environmental sustainability in the transition to clean energy for all. Achieving the targets of SDG 7 for Africa demands political leadership, policy and financial support to scale solutions across this vast and diverse continent. With coordinated action, universal access to sustainable modern energy can be achieved in Africa. But the clock is ticking.


 Here is a draft long-form analytical report on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Europe targeting an expert audience:

SDG 7: Progress on Affordable and Clean Energy Remains Insufficient  

Access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy continues to pose major challenges around the world. According to the latest estimates, 759 million people still lack access to electricity and about 2.6 billion people lack access to clean cooking fuels and technologies. The world is not on track to achieve universal access to energy by 2030 as envisioned in SDG 7.  

Progress on increasing the renewable energy mix and improving energy efficiency has been slow and uneven across regions. The share of renewable energy in the total final energy consumption grew modestly from 17.3% in 2010 to 17.5% in 2016, still well below the target of substantially increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. Improvements in energy intensity, a measure of energy efficiency, have stalled in recent years, highlighting the need for renewed policy focus and action. 

Major policy, investment and technology barriers persist in the transition to clean energy and sustainable energy access for all. Access to energy finance remains a major constraint, and annual global investment in renewable energy would need to double by 2020 to be on track for the 2030 targets. Modern renewables (excluding hydro over 50MW) received only $226 billion in investment in 2019, down from $288 billion in 2018. Distributed renewable energy solutions such as mini-grids and off-grid solar must be scaled up significantly but face challenges in accessing large capital pools. 

There are some bright spots and best practices that could be scaled up and replicated. Some countries have made progress in expanding access, increasing renewable energy and improving efficiency. Effective policy frameworks, innovative business models that leverage private finance, and new partnerships across sectors have been instrumental in driving progress. Knowledge sharing and capacity building to support energy transitions must be strengthened.

This report highlights the current status of SDG 7 and the major challenges that must urgently be addressed through policy actions, increased investments and technology innovation if the world is to achieve access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030. Concerted action across government, business and civil society is essential for developing sustainable energy roadmaps and accelerating progress during this critical Decade of Action.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) targeting an expert audience:

Access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all remains a critical challenge for the Latin America and Caribbean region. While there has been progress on energy access, with electrification rates reaching 95% across the region, tens of millions still lack access to clean and sustainable energy sources. The region continues to rely heavily on fossil fuels, with renewable energy making up only a small fraction of the total energy mix. Urgent action is needed to transition to renewable energy and increase efficiency if the region is to achieve SDG7 by 2030.  

Despite the progress in energy access, 38 million people in the region still lack access to electricity, while access to clean cooking remains a challenge for over 120 million people who rely on traditional biomass for cooking. The poorest and most vulnerable populations, including those living in remote and rural areas as well as indigenous communities, remain disproportionately affected by lack of energy access. With population growth putting increasing strain on energy systems, innovative policies and investments will be critical to provide universal access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy in the coming decade.

While the region has abundant renewable energy potential, especially in hydropower, solar and wind, the share of renewables in the total energy mix remains around 25%. The vast majority of energy generation still comes from fossil fuels, especially natural gas and oil. With energy demand projected to increase by as much as 50% in the next 15 years, a massive scale-up of renewable energy production will be needed to transition from carbon-intensive energy systems and meet the goal of doubling the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.  

Policies, regulations and incentives for renewable energy remain uneven across countries in the region. Some countries have adopted renewable energy targets and support schemes for technologies like solar and wind, but in many others, regulatory and market barriers persist. Mobilizing investment in renewable energy will require strengthening policy frameworks, adopting targeted incentives like auctions and tax rebates, and improving access to financing, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. Regional cooperation on grid integration and sharing best practices can also help accelerate the transition to renewables.

In summary, while there has been progress on energy access and renewables in Latin America and the Caribbean, accelerated action is urgently needed to achieve SDG7 by 2030. With political will and the right investments and policies, the region can achieve full access to energy for all and significantly scale up the share of renewable energy in the coming decade. But the window for action is closing fast. Urgent steps must be taken now to secure a sustainable energy future for all in Latin America and the Caribbean.


 Here is a draft long-form fictional analytical report on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP):

Promoting Access to Affordable, Reliable, and Clean Energy in Asia and the Pacific: An Assessment of Progress and Challenges on SDG 7  

Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services for all is crucial for sustainable development and poverty reduction in the Asia-Pacific region. Under SDG 7, countries have committed to substantially increasing the share of renewable energy and doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency and access by 2030. However, the latest data shows the region is not on track to meet these ambitious targets and accelerated progress on scaling up renewable energy and energy efficiency is urgently needed.  

Renewable Energy: The share of renewable energy in the total final energy consumption in Asia and the Pacific increased marginally from 15.7% in 2010 to 16.6% in 2017, still well below the global average of 17.5%. The renewable energy mix is dominated by traditional uses of biomass, which is often inefficient and unsustainable. Non-hydro modern renewable energy, such as solar and wind, accounted for only 4.2% of total final energy consumption in 2017. Despite rapid growth in recent years, especially for solar photovoltaics, the adoption of these technologies needs to accelerate at least fourfold to meet SDG 7 targets.  

Energy Efficiency: Improvements in energy efficiency are also lagging. Energy intensity - or energy used per unit of GDP - declined in Asia and the Pacific by only 2.2% annually between 2012 and 2017, below the 2.6-3.6% range needed to achieve SDG 7. Residential and transportation sectors continue to be major energy consumers, offering huge potential for efficiency gains through vehicle electrification, green building technologies, and sustainable city planning.Policy, financing and technology barriers, especially for low-income countries, will need to be addressed to capture these efficiency opportunities.   

Energy Access: Despite progress, some 320 million people across Asia and the Pacific still lack access to electricity and more than 1 billion lack access to clean cooking. The poorest countries, especially in South and Southeast Asia and Pacific island nations, continue to lag the furthest behind. Significant investments in on-grid and off-grid renewable energy solutions as well as clean cooking technologies are critically needed to ensure universal energy access.  

In summary, accelerated action on all aspects of SDG 7 is urgently needed for Asia and the Pacific to achieve clean and affordable energy for all by 2030. Renewable energy and energy efficiency must be scaled up, access to electricity and clean cooking expanded, with targeted policies, financing and technologies especially aimed at the poor. Regional cooperation will be key to meet these shared goals across borders and advance a sustainable energy transition for our planet’s future.  


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) targeting an expert audience:

Progress on SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy in the Arab Region 

Access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy is crucial for economic growth and human development in the Arab region. However, the Arab region faces significant challenges in achieving SDG 7 and providing universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services by 2030. 

According to the latest ESCWA report on progress towards the SDGs, only 58% of the population in the Arab region has access to electricity, compared to 89% globally. Access rates are lowest in Yemen at 46%, Djibouti at 48% and Sudan at 57%. The lack of access to electricity disproportionately impacts rural populations, with only 43% having access compared to 95% in urban areas. Significant investments in renewable and sustainable energy infrastructure will be needed to provide universal access, especially in least developed and conflict-affected countries.  

The Arab region also relies heavily on fossil fuels, with 94% of the total primary energy supply coming from oil and natural gas. This makes regional economies highly vulnerable to oil price fluctuations and market changes. Diversifying energy sources by transitioning to renewable energy is crucial for energy security and economic sustainability in the region. However, renewable energy makes up only a fraction of total installed capacity at around 1% for solar and 0.3% for wind. Hydropower provides 2.5% of capacity but is limited to a few countries. 

Advancing SDG 7 will require coordinated policy action and private sector engagement across the region. ESCWA recommends focusing on the following priority areas:

1. Improve energy efficiency and conservation through policy incentives, minimum performance standards and public-private partnerships. Reducing energy intensity can significantly decrease demand and emissions.

2.Adopt national renewable energy targets and policy incentives to spur clean energy investments. Feed-in tariffs, auctions, and renewable portfolio standards have been successful models in other regions.

3.Increase public and private capital flows for new energy infrastructure, especially for underserved areas and vulnerable populations. Blended finance can help mobilize funding for distributed renewable energy projects. 

4. Advance regional cooperation on energy trade, technology transfer, capacity building and knowledge sharing.A coordinated regional policy can accelerate the transition to sustainable energy through economies of scale.

5. Improve data collection and monitoring of SDG 7 indicators to better target policy interventions and track progress. More granular data on renewable energy adoption and energy efficiency gains is needed.

Significant progress on SDG 7 will require political will, strategic investments, and coordinated policy action across all sectors of society. By transitioning to affordable, reliable and renewable energy, the Arab region can meet the SDGs, improve energy security, and build low-carbon sustainable economies. ESCWA remains committed to supporting member states in their efforts to provide sustainable energy for all.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of UN DESA targeting an expert audience and focused on middle-income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensuring Access to Affordable, Reliable, Sustainable and Modern Energy for All 

Progress on SDG 7 for universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services has been slow and uneven across the globe, especially in middle-income countries. According to recent estimates, nearly 1 billion people still lack access to electricity, and around 3 billion people lack access to clean cooking solutions and rely on inefficient and polluting traditional biomass for cooking and heating. The global rate of progress needs to accelerate dramatically if the world is to achieve universal access to sustainable energy for all by 2030 in line with the SDG 7 commitments. 

In many middle-income countries, economic growth and rising incomes have not automatically translated into expanded access to clean and affordable energy for marginalized groups and remote populations. Large investments in energy infrastructure have prioritized expanding supply to meet the demands of commercial and industrial sectors over serving poor and marginalized communities. As a result, progress on clean cooking access and distributed renewable energy has lagged. Changing course will require targeted policies and investments to ramp up clean energy access in underserved areas and for marginalized groups.

The good news is that the costs of key technologies like solar panels, batteries and LED lighting have plunged in recent years, making decentralized and distributed renewable energy more viable. Many middle-income countries also have burgeoning clean energy sectors poised for growth, with the potential for job creation and economic opportunity. But policy reforms and new partnerships are urgently needed to unlock this potential and channel more investment into energy access. 

National governments should make universal access to sustainable energy a higher priority, and set concrete targets and timelines for achieving key SDG 7 milestones, especially for clean cooking and distributed renewables. They must work to mobilize new sources of finance, especially for underfunded areas like clean cooking, and enact policies to stimulate private sector participation. Development partners should provide targeted support for projects extending energy access in marginalized communities and remote areas.

With concerted action and political will, middle-income countries have the means to close the energy access gap and meet the SDG 7 targets. But the clock is ticking. Greater urgency and ambition are required to seize this opportunity and unleash the full potential of sustainable energy access for all.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on the current status of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, with a focus on middle income countries:

Current Progress on SDG 7 on Affordable and Clean Energy in Middle Income Countries 

Access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy is crucial for sustainable development, particularly in middle income countries that continue to urbanize and industrialize rapidly. SDG 7 aims to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, and double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.

Progress on SDG 7 among middle income countries in Asia and the Pacific has been uneven. Some countries have made tremendous strides in improving energy access and transitioning to renewable energy, while other countries continue to lag behind. According to recent estimates, 89% of the population in the region have access to electricity, but over 400 million people still lack access, especially in rural and remote areas. While renewable energy use has increased in many countries, the share of renewables in total final energy consumption remains under 10% for the region. Improvements in energy efficiency have also stalled in recent years. 

Several challenges hamper greater progress on SDG 7 in the region. First, lack of investments in modern energy infrastructure, especially in expanding electricity grids and renewable energy projects, remains an obstacle. Although private sector investments in clean energy have increased, public sector investments have declined in some countries. Second, fossil fuel subsidies continue to be pervasive, discouraging transitions to renewable energy and energy efficiency. Phasing out such subsidies remains politically difficult but is urgently needed. Third, lack of cooperation on cross-border energy connectivity, such as through power grid interconnections and natural gas pipeline networks, hinders efficient use of energy resources in the region. 

Notwithstanding these challenges, opportunities abound for middle income countries in Asia and the Pacific to make rapid progress on SDG 7. Advancements in renewable energy and energy storage technologies can enable more decentralized and "leapfrogging" approaches to energy access. Growing environmental consciousness among populations and policymakers have also increased political will for energy transition in many countries. Regional cooperation frameworks can facilitate cross-border energy connectivity and knowledge sharing on best practices.

To accelerate progress on SDG 7, middle income countries should adopt more ambitious policy measures and targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency, backed by public investments, policy incentives and regulatory changes. Partnerships with private sector, civil society and development partners must also be strengthened through inclusive policy dialogues and coordinated actions across sectors and countries. Transition to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy will be crucial for the region's development in the coming decades. Overall, with strong political commitment and global partnerships, achieving SDG 7 in Asia and the Pacific is within reach.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population and Inclusive Societies Division, targeting an expert audience and focusing on middle-income countries:

Progress on Sustainable Development Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy in Middle-Income Countries  

Access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy is crucial for social and economic development. Sustainable Development Goal 7 aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030. This report provides an in-depth analysis of progress on SDG 7, with a focus on trends in middle-income countries based on available data and reports from international organizations including the UN regional commissions.  

Many middle-income countries have achieved near-universal access to electricity over the past two decades, connecting millions of people to power grids and distributed renewable energy systems. However, population growth means the absolute number of people without access remains high at over 600 million, concentrated in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Rates of access and reliability vary substantially within countries based on location, income, and other factors. Access to clean fuels and technology for cooking remains a challenge, with over 2.8 billion people still relying on traditional biomass, coal or kerosene.  

Investment in renewable energy has grown rapidly, but still only makes up a small fraction of total energy investment. Hydropower and solar energy account for the vast majority of renewable energy use. While the costs of solar and wind power have declined dramatically, policy and market barriers persist. Fossil fuels remain dominant in the overall energy mix for most middle-income countries. Several countries have enacted policies, regulations and economic incentives to promote renewable energy adoption, but regulation and enforcement remain weak in some regions.

Regional partnerships and cooperation on energy access, efficiency and renewable transitions show promise but require strengthening. There are opportunities for middle-income countries to leapfrog carbon-intensive energy pathways by adopting and sharing best practices for distributed renewable energy, grid modernization, and policy frameworks facilitating sustainable energy transitions. Accelerated progress will require targeted investments, technological innovation, and policy changes to ensure the poor and marginalized communities also benefit from the transition to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy. 

In summary, while there has been significant progress on SDG 7 in middle-income countries, accelerated action is urgently needed to achieve the 2030 targets, especially for the poorest and most vulnerable populations. Success will depend on partnerships, cooperation and political will at all levels to promote access, efficiency and renewable energy.


 Here is a draft lengthy analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the UN DESA Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DISD) targeting an expert audience and focused on middle-income countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 7: Progress and Challenges in Middle-Income Countries  

Introduction
Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all is a crucial element of sustainable development and a key objective under SDG 7. Significant progress has been made in increasing access to electricity and clean cooking fuels, yet major challenges remain, especially in middle-income countries (MICs) which comprise a large portion of the global population. This report analyzes recent progress, trends, and obstacles related to SDG 7 for MICs based on the latest data and reports from the UN system, World Bank, and other stakeholders.  

Recent Progress and Trends
According to the latest SE4ALL Global Tracking Framework report, the proportion of the global population with access to electricity increased from 83% in 2010 to 90% in 2018. The number of people without access declined from 1.2 billion to 840 million over the same period. Progress was significant in Asia and Latin America but slower in Sub-Saharan Africa. The growth of renewable energy has also been strong, increasing to 17.5% of total final energy consumption in 2017. Solar and wind power have seen substantial cost reductions.

For MICs, the rate of new connections has slowed in recent years, suggesting easier gains have already been achieved. The remaining unelectrified populations tend to be in remote, hard-to-reach areas where grid extension is challenging. Clean cooking access in MICs, especially for the poor, remains very low at only about 40% of households. Use of polluting fuels and technologies leads to over 4 million premature deaths annually according to WHO estimates.  

Key Obstacles and Challenges
There are several key challenges facing MICs in achieving SDG 7:

1) Limited public funding: Most MIC governments have limited fiscal space to finance energy access and clean energy programs, especially due to the economic crisis induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Blended finance and private investment must play a larger role. 

2) Affordability: Even where modern energy services are available, they remain unaffordable for large parts of the population in many MICs. Innovative business models and targeted subsidies are needed to reach the poorest households.  

3) Climate change: Many MICs are experiencing more frequent and intense climate-related disasters which threaten energy infrastructure and access. They have limited capacity to adapt systems and build resilience. Climate change also exacerbates other challenges like water scarcity which impacts hydropower.

4) Transition challenges: Fossil fuels still dominate energy systems in most MICs. Transitioning to renewable energy and more efficient technologies at a large scale will require overcoming political, economic and social obstacles.

5) Limited capacity: There is a deficit of technical skills and institutional capacity related to energy access, renewable energy, and energy efficiency in many MICs which hampers their ability to design and implement effective policies and programs. Capacity building is urgently needed.

In summary, while good progress has been achieved in expanding energy access and deploying renewable energy in MICs under SDG 7, accelerated efforts are still required to close remaining gaps, especially for the poorest and most vulnerable groups. Targeted policies, innovative finance, climate adaptation, transition management and capacity building can help MICs overcome key barriers to progress. The UN system and development partners have an important role to play in supporting these countries through access to finance, knowledge sharing, and technical assistance.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the UN Division for Sustainable Development Goals targeting an expert audience and focused on middle-income countries:

Progress on SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy in Middle-Income Countries  

Access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy is crucial for sustainable development and poverty eradication. SDG 7 aims to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030. This goal requires increasing renewable energy in the global energy mix, doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency and providing universal access. 

Progress on SDG 7 among middle-income countries over the past year has been mixed. On the positive side, renewable energy capacity and generation continues to increase in many middle-income countries, with solar and wind power being added to electricity grids at record rates. The costs of solar and wind continue to decline, making renewable energy more affordable and cost-competitive. Some middle-income countries have also made progress on energy efficiency, for example by tightening fuel economy standards for vehicles.  

However, progress is still too slow to achieve SDG 7 by 2030 and broader challenges remain. Hundreds of millions of people in middle-income countries still lack access to electricity and clean cooking fuels, especially in rural and remote areas. While renewable energy is growing quickly, fossil fuels still dominate the energy mix in most middle-income countries. Government policies, regulatory frameworks and incentives often favor fossil fuels over renewable energy.  

More action is urgently needed by governments and other stakeholders to accelerate progress on SDG 7 in middle-income countries:

•Rapidly scale up renewable energy capacity by providing financial incentives, investment in infrastructure, and clear and consistent policies and targets. Phase out fossil fuel subsidies.

•Increase public and private investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Set more ambitious energy efficiency standards for buildings, vehicles and appliances.

•Provide universal access to electricity and clean cooking fuels, especially to vulnerable groups in rural and remote areas. Use decentralized renewable energy solutions where grid connectivity is challenging.  

•Reform fossil-fuel centered policies, regulations, pricing and taxation to create a level playing field for renewable energy. Remove barriers to renewable energy integration in grids.

•Increase international cooperation on technology transfer, capacity building and financing to support SDG 7 progress in middle-income countries. Develop regional electricity grids and markets to share renewable energy more widely.

With accelerated action, renewable energy can usher in a new era of affordable, reliable and sustainable energy for all in middle-income countries. But the window for action is closing fast. Urgent progress on SDG 7 is needed to change course towards a clean energy transition and more prosperous future for the planet.


 Here is a draft long analytical report on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the UN DESA Division for Sustainable Development Goals:

Sustainable Development Goal 7: Progress and Challenges in Middle-Income Countries 

Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all remains a crucial challenge for sustainable development, especially in middle-income countries. While these countries have made progress expanding access to electricity, over 1 billion people still lack access to electricity and clean cooking fuels according to recent estimates. Energy is crucial for achieving nearly all of the SDGs, so accelerated progress on SDG 7 is urgently needed.

Electricity access: According to the latest SDG data, 89% of the world’s population now has access to electricity, up from 83% in 2010. However, the rate of new access has slowed in recent years, and significant gaps remain in Sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia. Among middle-income countries, access ranges from 99% in China to just 65% in India. While China has achieved near-universal access, India will require sustained high growth to achieve universal access by 2030. Expanding transmission and distribution infrastructure in remote and rural areas remains a key challenge. 

Reliance on fossil fuels: The majority of the world still relies on fossil fuels for energy, contributing to climate change. Coal continues to dominate for electricity and industrial uses. Among middle-income countries, South Africa and Poland remain heavily dependent on coal, while Thailand and Brazil also rely on oil and gas. Transitioning to renewable energy is urgently needed to meet climate change targets, though this transition requires massive investments.

Inequality in access: Even in middle-income countries with relatively high aggregate access to electricity, vast inequalities remain in access and reliability. Slums and marginalized communities often lack access to modern energy services. Women and girls also suffer disproportionately, as they frequently spend many hours collecting fuelwood and have limited access to electricity for productive uses. More policy focus is needed on “leaving no one behind.”

Clean cooking: Access to clean cooking fuels and technologies remains far too low, with little progress in recent years. Over 40% of the world's population still cooks with polluting fuels like wood, charcoal, coal and kerosene. These fuels are a major cause of health problems and premature death. Among middle-income countries, only 30-60% of populations have access to clean cooking depending on the region. Urgent policy incentives and investments are needed to accelerate transitions to clean cooking.

 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of a UNDP report targeting an expert audience and focused on middle-income countries:

Access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all remains a critical challenge and key enabler of sustainable development. While many middle-income countries have made progress on improving access to electricity, over 1 billion people still lack access to energy and many more lack access to clean cooking solutions, disproportionately affecting the poor and marginalized. Meeting SDG 7 will require increasing political commitment, policy and regulatory reforms, technology innovation, and partnerships to scale up public and private investment in clean energy infrastructure and technologies.  

Gaps in energy access persist in many middle-income countries, especially for vulnerable and marginalized populations. In lower middle-income countries, over 70% of the population has access to electricity but there are still 300 million without access. Access rates are even lower for clean cooking, with only 30-40% of people using clean cooking solutions. Rural and poorer communities often lag far behind. In many countries, policies and regulations do not adequately incentivize extending energy access to these groups. Addressing these inequities will require targeted policies, community-based approaches, and new partnerships and business models that can provide affordable solutions for the poor.

The transition to clean energy is progressing but not quickly enough. While renewable energy production and use is growing rapidly, it still only comprises a small fraction of total energy use. In many countries, renewable energy targets are not ambitious enough and policy/regulatory incentives remain insufficient. Fossil fuel subsidies also persist, distorting energy markets. Urgent action is needed to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, increase renewable energy targets, improve policy and planning, catalyze private sector investment, and scale up funding for new renewable energy projects and infrastructure. New renewable technologies also need support to reach competitiveness. 

In conclusion, while middle-income countries have made progress on SDG 7, accelerated action is urgently needed to achieve universal access  to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. Stronger political commitments, policy reforms, new partnerships and increased investments can help close persistent gaps in energy access, scale up renewable energy and transition countries to more sustainable energy systems. But achieving SDG 7 will require tackling systemic issues and transforming how we produce and use energy. Success can unlock progress across the 2030 Agenda.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of UNCTAD targeting an expert audience and focused on middle-income countries:

Progress on SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy in Middle-Income Countries  

Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030 remains an immense challenge, especially for middle-income countries. While these countries have experienced significant economic growth and improvements in standards of living in recent decades, nearly 800 million people still lack access to electricity and clean cooking fuels in middle-income countries, according to UN estimates. Urgent action is needed to transition these populations to more sustainable energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change.  

Access to electricity has increased in middle-income countries, but 4 out of 10 people still lack access. Electricity access in middle-income countries grew from 73% of the population in 2000 to 83% in 2018 according to the latest World Bank data. However, population growth means the total number of people without access has remained stagnant at around 800 million. Rural and remote areas continue to lag in access, with electrification rates up to 30 percentage points lower than in urban areas. Significant investments in grid infrastructure and decentralized renewable energy solutions are needed to reach the remaining populations. 

The share of renewable energy in the total energy mix is increasing but remains low. The renewable energy share of total final energy consumption in middle-income countries grew from around 6% in 2000 to over 8% in 2017, according to IRENA. However, the total renewable share needs to increase fivefold to meet the 2030 target of 36% in the Sustainable Energy for All scenario. Solar and wind power have driven recent gains, reflecting declining costs and technology improvements. But hydropower and bioenergy remain the dominant sources and continued expansion of renewables will require policy and market reforms to incentivize further deployment of solar and wind.

Energy intensity continues to decline but greater efficiency gains are needed. Energy intensity, measured as energy use per unit of GDP, declined by nearly 30% in middle-income countries from 2000 to 2017 according to UN DESA, as economies have transitioned from energy-intensive industries to less intensive service sectors. However, the rate of decline needs to accelerate to reach the 3% annual reduction target. This will require policies and investments to improve energy efficiency in buildings, transportation and industrial processes. Mass adoption of more efficient technologies and changes in user behavior will also be critical to bend the curve.

In summary, while middle-income countries have made progress on SDG 7, accelerated action is urgently needed to expand access to electricity and clean cooking, transition to renewable energy and improve energy efficiency. With concerted efforts and targeted investments in coming years, these countries can achieve SDG 7 and reap the economic, social and environmental benefits of sustainable energy for all. But the decade of action must start now. The costs of inaction are too great.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Africa, targeted at an expert audience and focused on middle-income countries:

Progress on Sustainable Development Goal 7 in Middle-Income Countries: An Assessment 

Access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy is crucial for sustainable development and poverty reduction in middle-income countries (MICs). As MICs continue their development trajectories, demand for energy is rising rapidly. Meeting this demand in a sustainable manner is key to achieving many of the Sustainable Development Goals, including improved health outcomes, education, gender equality, and economic opportunity. 

According to recent estimates, nearly 800 million people in MICs still lack access to electricity. While great progress has been made in expanding energy access through grid expansion and distributed renewable energy sources, current rates of progress need to accelerate significantly to achieve universal access to energy by 2030 in line with SDG 7. Off-grid and mini-grid solutions will be essential to reach the most remote and underserved communities. Public-private partnerships, innovative financing models, and investments in research and development can help drive further progress.

The share of renewable energy in the total final energy consumption remains relatively low in most MICs, at around 5-10% according to UN DESA estimates. Hydropower and solar energy present significant untapped potential for many MICs, but investments in wind, geothermal and other renewable sources also need to scale up dramatically. Policy support through renewable energy targets, feed-in tariffs, and incentives for private sector involvement will be key to transitioning MIC energy systems to more renewable and sustainable sources in line with the SDG 7 target of increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.  

Energy efficiency improvements offer major opportunities for MICs to reduce energy consumption and costs. Gaps remain in standards, labeling programs, and incentives to drive the adoption of more efficient technologies and practices across sectors including transport, buildings, and industry. Targeted policies and financing programs to enable widespread use of efficient equipment and retrofits would yield sizeable benefits. Multilateral development banks and climate funds can help catalyze greater investment in energy efficiency.

In summary, while MICs have made substantial progress on SDG 7, accelerated action is urgently needed to achieve universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030 through investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and energy access. Success will require strong political commitment, policy leadership, innovative partnerships, and scaled up flows of public and private capital to the energy sector. Urgent steps must be taken now to ensure MICs have sustainable energy for powering their continued economic growth and development.

Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all  

Progress on SDG 7 in Middle-Income Countries

Access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy is crucial for economic growth, poverty eradication, and sustainable development. Middle-income countries, as a group, have made important strides in improving energy access and transitioning to sustainable energy sources, though significant challenges remain, especially in providing universal access.

According to the latest data, almost all people in middle-income countries now have access to electricity, including over 95% of urban populations and over 85% of rural populations. However, nearly 500 million people still lack access, especially in rural and remote areas. Providing universal access will require targeted investments in grid expansion as well as off-grid and mini-grid solutions. Electrical grids also need to be upgraded and modernized in many middle-income countries to improve the reliability and sustainability of supply. 

With respect to clean and modern energy, the share of renewable energy in the total final energy consumption has increased in middle-income countries over the last decade to over 15%. However, 85% of total energy needs are still met by fossil fuels, indicating more progress is urgently needed to transition economies to sustainable energy and meet climate goals. Investments in solar, wind and other renewable energy technologies have been rising but need to accelerate further. Many middle-income countries would also benefit from improving energy efficiency, which can generate energy savings of up to 30% in some sectors.

Overall, middle-income countries have strong potential to achieve SDG 7 but face sizable challenges, especially in: 1) providing universal access to electricity in rural and remote areas; 2) modernizing and upgrading outdated grid infrastructure; 3) transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable and sustainable energy sources; and 4) improving energy efficiency across sectors. Targeted policy, regulatory and financial support can help overcome these challenges and put middle-income countries on track to meet SDG 7. But political will and ambitious, forward-looking policymaking will be required to transition economies to clean, affordable and sustainable energy for all.  


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report in the style of ECLAC on the progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) with a focus on middle-income countries:

Progress on SDG 7 in Middle-Income Countries: Challenges and Opportunities  

Access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy remains an ongoing challenge for middle-income countries striving to achieve sustainable development. While these countries have seen economic growth and increasing standards of living in recent decades, large parts of the population still lack access to clean and affordable energy sources. Achieving universal access to energy is crucial for powering prosperity, enabling productive economic activity, and improving health and education outcomes. 

According to the latest data, 789 million people still lack access to electricity worldwide, over 70% of whom live in middle-income countries. The rate of new electrification has slowed in recent years, with the increase in 2018 being the smallest in over a decade. At the current pace, 620 million will still lack access in 2030, falling short of the SDG 7 target. Rural and poor populations are the least likely to have access, with significant gaps between urban and rural electrification rates in many countries. 

While renewable energy sources have seen rapid growth, the share of renewables in the total final energy consumption grew only modestly from 17.5% in 2010 to 17.8% in 2017. Much of the growth in renewable electricity generation has come from solar and wind, but hydropower still makes up the vast majority of renewable energy use. However, growth in renewable energy use is uneven across regions. Parts of Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia have seen more substantial progress, while growth in the small island nations of the Pacific has been more limited.

[The report would continue with additional details on specific challenges and country case studies for several middle-income nations in different regions. It would provide statistics and data to substantiate the analysis and discuss policy, technology, and financing options to accelerate progress. Additional sections would cover topics such as improving energy efficiency, transitioning to more sustainable heating and cooking fuels, and integrating more renewable energy into transportation and industrial systems.]


 Here is a draft lengthy analytical report in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7): Affordable and Clean Energy, with a focus on middle-income countries:

Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all remains a crucial challenge across Asia and the Pacific, particularly for middle-income countries. According to the latest data, over 420 million people in the Asia-Pacific region still lack access to electricity. The progress on SDG 7 has been mixed, with some successes but also many challenges that require urgent action. 

On the positive side, several middle-income countries have made strides in improving energy access in recent years. Thailand, Malaysia and China have already achieved universal access to electricity. Countries like India, Philippines, Vietnam and others have also expanded energy access through grid extension and off-grid solutions. Renewable energy has increased significantly in the region, with solar and wind energy spearheading the growth. The adoption of more efficient and clean cookstoves and fuels has also gained momentum.  

However, much more needs to be done to achieve SDG 7. Energy intensity and per capita energy consumption in the region remains well below developed country levels, constraining economic and social progress. Hundreds of millions still rely on traditional biomass for cooking and heating, causing severe health issues. The share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption is still low for most countries relative to targets. The affordability of clean energy options also continues to be a challenge, especially for poor and remote populations. 

To accelerate progress, ESCAP recommends the following priority actions for middle-income countries:

1. Increase public and private investments in energy infrastructure, especially for renewable energy expansion and modern energy for rural and remote areas.  Policy reforms are needed to spur private sector investments.

2. Improve access to affordable financing for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. De-risk private sector investments through credit guarantees, green bonds, and public-private partnerships.   

3. Expand and improve electricity grids and increase decentralized energy options through mini-grids and off-grid solar systems for the last mile connections. Engage local communities to ensure affordability and sustainability.  

4. Target clean cooking interventions such as clean cookstoves, LPG and biogas through awareness campaigns, subsidies, and public-private distribution partnerships especially for poorer households and women.

5. Increase regional cooperation on sustainable energy through knowledge sharing, technology transfer, and joint projects. Harness the potential of regional power trade and grids.

 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) and focused on middle-income countries:

 Progress on SDG 7 in Middle-Income Countries: An Analysis 

Access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy is crucial for development and for achieving many of the SDGs and targets. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the progress on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) by middle-income countries in the ESCWA region based on a review of official data and reports as well as insights from regional experts and stakeholders.  

The good news is that significant progress has been made on improving access to electricity in the region’s middle-income countries over the past decade, with rates of electrification increasing by over 10 percentage points since 2010. Nearly all middle-income countries have achieved universal or near-universal access to electricity, with some aiming to reach the remaining unserved populations within the next few years. However, there are still over 30 million people without access to electricity in the region’s middle-income countries, especially in more remote and underdeveloped areas.

Progress on clean and renewable energy has been slower. While installed renewable energy capacity has grown, the share of renewable energy in the total final energy consumption remains below the global average in most middle-income countries in the region. Hydropower and solar energy have seen the biggest increases, but wind and geothermal remain underutilized. Energy efficiency has also improved too gradually, with primary energy intensity declining at less than 2% per year on average. At this rate, most middle-income countries will not meet the target of doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.

Financing and investment in the energy sector remain major challenges. Although public and private investment in renewable energy has increased, it is still a fraction of investment in fossil fuels. Access to international climate funds and development assistance has helped but domestic public funding and private finance need to play a bigger role. Policy and regulatory frameworks also need further development and updating to fully support the transition to sustainable energy in line with SDG 7.

In conclusion, while middle-income countries in the ESCWA region have made progress on SDG 7, accelerated and innovative actions are urgently needed to achieve universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030 and to transition to greener sources of energy. With targeted policies, increased investment, technology partnerships and regional cooperation, SDG 7 can be achieved in the region. But the next decade will be critical.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of UN DESA targeting an expert audience:

Progress on SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy Remains Slow, Urgent Action Needed  
The progress on Sustainable Development Goal 7, which aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, remains slow according to the latest analyses by UN DESA. While there has been incremental progress on expanding access to electricity in recent years, an estimated 840 million people still lack access, with most residing in Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDS), and Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs). The rate of progress needs to quadruple to achieve universal access to electricity by 2030. Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking remains even more limited, with 3.8 billion people still cooking with traditional fuels like wood, charcoal, and dung.  

Renewable energy continues to gain ground, but remains underutilized. The share of renewable energy in the total final energy consumption increased from 16.3% in 2010 to 17.5% in 2017. However, the rate of deployment must accelerate to meet the SDG 7 target of doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency and substantially increasing the share of renewable energy in the energy mix. Hydropower continues to produce the largest share of renewable electricity globally, but solar and wind continue their rapid rise - yet still only make up 1.1% of total final energy consumption. The transition to clean energy is moving far too slowly. Urgent action is needed to scale up renewable energy six times faster to be on track for the SDG 7 targets.

 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the UN DESA Economic Analysis and Policy Division targeting an expert audience:

Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all   

Progress on SDG 7 remains uneven across regions and country groups. Least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) continue to face significant challenges in achieving universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy. Despite some progress, broad swaths of populations in these vulnerable countries still lack access to electricity and clean cooking fuels and technologies.   

According to ESCAP, as of 2018 in the Asia-Pacific region, one out of every two people in LDCs lacks access to electricity, compared to a global average of one in seven. The electrification rate in LDCs is only about 47%, far below the global rate of 87%. The situation is particularly dire in several Pacific SIDS, where up to 95% of people in some countries still lack 24-hour access to power. Access to clean cooking fuels and technologies also remains low. Roughly 67% of people in LDCs and 58% of people in SIDS rely on polluting and unhealthy fuels and stoves for cooking.  

In sub-Saharan Africa, the electrification rate is only 45% according to UN DESA, meaning over 600 million people still lack access to electricity, primarily in rural areas. Clean cooking access is only 8% across the region. Per UNDP, in certain LLDCs like Zimbabwe, South Sudan and Chad, more than 85% of the population cooks with solid biomass, which leads to poor health outcomes particularly for women and children.   

The lack of progress on SDG 7 in these vulnerable countries can be attributed to several factors....[Detailed analysis on key barriers and challenges including lack of finance and investment, infrastructure gaps, poverty and inequality, lack of political will and policy failures, limited technical capabilities, and climate change impacts].  

To accelerate progress, the international community must take bold actions....[Recommendations around increasing concessional finance, building institutional capacity, facilitating technology transfer, implementing policy reforms, investing in distributed renewable energy and energy efficiency, strengthening regional cooperation, gathering better data, targeting interventions for marginalized groups, and boosting political leadership].

Progress on SDG 7 will require coordinated global partnership and solidarity to ensure affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy becomes a reality for even the poorest and most vulnerable countries and communities around the world. But achieving this goal could unlock tremendous benefits for human development, and help put these countries and their populations on more sustainable and inclusive growth pathways.


 Here is a draft long-form analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the requested style:

Ensuring Access to Affordable, Reliable, Sustainable and Modern Energy for All: Progress and Challenges in Achieving SDG 7, with a Focus on Vulnerable Countries  

I) Introduction 

Access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy is crucial for global development and achieving many of the SDGs and targets. SDG 7 calls for universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services by 2030. It also calls for substantially increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix and doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.  

Progress on SDG 7 has been uneven across regions and country groups. Vulnerable countries like least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) face particular challenges in achieving reliable, sustainable, and modern energy access due to lack of infrastructure, skills, and financing. They have disproportionately low electrification rates and high reliance on traditional biomass, highlighting the need for targeted support.

II) Global progress and trends 

Globally, substantial progress has been made on several SDG 7 targets. Access to electricity increased from 83% in 2010 to 90% in 2018. The share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption grew modestly from 17.5% in 2010 to 17.8% in 2017. Improvements in energy intensity - the ratio of energy used per unit of GDP - averaged 2.1% annually from 2010 to 2017, exceeding the 2030 target of doubling the improvement rate.

However, major gaps remain for vulnerable groups. In LDCs, only 65% of the population had access to electricity in 2018. In SIDS, renewable energy made up just 11%  of total energy use in 2017, well below the 30% target for 2030. Energy intensity improvement in LLDCs averaged just 1.4% over 2010 to 2017, far short of doubling the rate. Clearly, much more needs to be done to ensure affordable and sustainable energy access for all.   

[The response continues with several more paragraphs on challenges, government and private sector actions, recommendations, and a conclusion.]


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) targeting an expert audience:

SDG 7: Achieving Universal Access to Clean Energy 
by 2030 in Vulnerable Countries  

Access to affordable and clean energy remains an immense challenge for the least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). According to the latest data from UN DESA's Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DSDG), nearly 770 million people in LDCs still lack access to electricity. The situation is even more dire in rural and remote areas within these countries. The proportion of the rural population with access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking was only 23% in LDCs in 2017. 

Multiple factors have led to the energy access deficits in these vulnerable countries. They face disproportionately higher energy costs due to lack of economies of scale in energy production and distribution as well as heavy dependence on fossil fuel imports. Limited land areas and natural resources in SIDS constrain their ability to develop indigenous and renewable energy sources. Infrastructure gaps in LLDCs due to lack of cross-border connectivity severely undermine their energy security. Poverty and lack of awareness about energy efficiency and renewable technologies also form major barriers to achieving SDG 7.

To address these challenges, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) recommend intensifying targeted interventions in the following areas:

1. Increased investments in renewable energy generation and distribution. Vulnerable countries have high potential for solar, wind, geothermal and ocean energy due to their natural endowments. Special funds should be set up to subsidize initial capital costs of setting up renewable energy projects in these countries. Microgrid and off-grid solutions should be prioritized for remote rural communities. 

2. Improve energy efficiency and access to clean cooking fuels. Promoting efficienct stoves, improving insulation, and switching to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and biofuels can significantly reduce energy costs and environmental degradation from traditional biomass use for cooking and heating, especially in rural areas. 

3. Enhance cross-border energy connectivity. Regional energy connectivity projects should be undertaken to link energy surplus countries with energy-deficient countries. For example, hydropower from landlocked Central Africa could be connected to neighboring coastal countries. Regional power pools could help achieve scale economies for energy trade.  

4. Build local capacity in energy sectors. Technical assistance and training programs are needed across energy production, distribution, and consumption to educate communities and strengthen local institutions in charge of policymaking and regulation in the energy sector.  

In conclusion, concerted global efforts across governments, private sector, civil society and international organizations are urgently required to accelerate progress towards achieving universal access to clean energy in the world's most vulnerable countries. With the deadline for the 2030 Agenda fast approaching, SDG 7 should be a top priority to enable inclusive and sustainable development globally.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all) in the style of the UN Division for Sustainable Development Goals, targeting an expert audience and focusing on least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries:

Ensuring Universal Access to Energy: Progress and Challenges in Vulnerable Countries 

Access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy remains a significant challenge across the globe, but particularly in least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries. These vulnerable countries face unique barriers to achieving SDG 7 given their lack of infrastructure, high costs of energy access, heavy reliance on fossil fuels, and vulnerability to climate change impacts like extreme weather events that can disrupt energy systems.

Progress is being made, but not quickly enough. According to the latest data, 80% of the population in least developed countries still lack access to electricity, and 95% lack access to clean cooking. In small island developing states and landlocked developing countries, 30-50% of populations remain without electricity. Major investments in renewable energy are urgently needed to provide affordable and sustainable energy access for the over 1 billion people still living in the dark. The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to slow or reverse progress as governments and donors shift funds and priorities. 

National governments have an important role to play in incentivizing energy access through policy and regulation. Some least developed countries have launched ambitious national electrification plans to reach full access by 2030, but most lack the financial and technical capacity for large-scale implementation. Development partners can provide targeted assistance through data collection, grid extension, off-grid solar systems, clean cooking access, and resilience-building for vulnerable energy infrastructure. Regional cooperation on cross-border energy connectivity and trade can also boost access.    

Significant investments in renewable energy are also key for affordable and sustainable energy access that supports long-term development. With abundant solar, hydro and wind resources, vulnerable countries can leapfrog fossil fuel-based energy systems, but currently 95-99% of populations in these countries rely on polluting and unhealthy fuels like kerosene, charcoal and wood for cooking. Donors should prioritize funding for renewable energy mini-grids, solar home systems, and clean cookstoves to provide truly sustainable energy for all.

In summary, accelerating progress on SDG 7 in vulnerable countries will require substantial international support and political will for enhancing energy access through renewable, decentralized and resilient solutions tailored to communities most in need. With clear strategies, strong policies, innovative financing and a shared commitment to leave no one behind, universal access to sustainable energy can be achieved. But the time for action is now.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the UN DESA Financing for Sustainable Development Office (FSDO) targeting an expert audience:

SDG 7: Progress and Challenges in Increasing Access to Affordable and Clean Energy in Vulnerable Countries  

While progress has been made in increasing access to electricity and clean energy globally, the least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) continue to face significant challenges in achieving universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all by 2030 in line with SDG 7. 

According to the latest data, over 840 million people still lack access to electricity, with the vast majority located in sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia. Within LDCs, only about 44% of the population has access to electricity. The rate is even lower in rural areas at only 24%. The lack of access to modern energy services severely hinders socioeconomic development and the ability of households and businesses to escape from poverty. At the current pace of progress, 620 million people will still be left without access in 2030.

For SIDS and LLDCs, the challenges are even more substantial given their geographical constraints and vulnerabilities. Their small populations, limited resources, infrastructure, and technical capacity make progress difficult. They also face disproportionately higher costs for energy due to reliance on imported fossil fuels. At the same time, they have significant potential for developing local renewable energy resources, including solar, wind, geothermal and hydro. But greater investments and technology transfer are urgently needed.

Financing the energy transition in these vulnerable countries remains the biggest obstacle...[Additional 2-3 pages of analysis and recommendations in the style of FSDO follows with details on: investments needed and current flows, policy and regulatory reforms, integrating energy access and climate goals, potential of decentralized and renewable energy, capacity building needs, data and monitoring challenges, role of public-private partnerships, South-South cooperation, etc.]

In summary, while the 2030 Agenda calls for leaving no one behind, the most vulnerable countries are at risk of missing out on progress on SDG 7 without greater global solidarity and targeted action. Achieving the vision of affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all will require strengthened partnerships at all levels to unlock the needed investments, close the energy access gap, and ensure a just transition to clean energy for the 1.1 billion people still in the dark.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of UNDP targeting an expert audience:

Ensuring Access to Affordable, Reliable, Sustainable and Modern Energy for All: Progress and Challenges for Least Developed Countries, Small Island Developing States and Landlocked Developing Countries  

Executive Summary
Access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy is crucial for economic growth, improved livelihoods and sustainable development. While progress has been made on increasing access to electricity and clean energy globally, least developed countries, small island developing states and landlocked developing countries continue to lag behind. This report provides an analysis of the state of SDG 7 for these vulnerable country groups, identifies key challenges and opportunities, and provides recommendations for accelerated action. 

State of SDG 7 for Vulnerable Countries
According to latest estimates from the SEforALL Global Tracking Framework, over 88% of people in least developed countries, small island developing states and landlocked developing countries have access to electricity, but only about 66% have access to clean cooking fuels and technologies. Rates of energy efficiency and renewable energy development also remain low. Key challenges include lack of access to finance and technology, high upfront costs of infrastructure, heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels, and vulnerability to price volatility and natural disasters.

Despite these challenges, opportunities exist to increase access through decentralized renewable energy systems, improve energy efficiency, invest in grid infrastructure, and promote south-south cooperation on technology and knowledge transfers. Regional cooperation on energy trading and infrastructure connectivity can also help landlocked developing countries. Targeted policies and partnerships to mobilize private sector investment in renewable energy and "green finance" are other opportunities.

Recommendations for Accelerated Action
To accelerate progress on SDG 7, the following actions are recommended:

1. Increase official development assistance and climate finance for energy access and renewable energy projects in vulnerable countries. Concessional loans and grants are key to overcoming high upfront costs.

2. Improve regulatory environments and policy frameworks to attract greater private sector investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Partnerships with development banks and green banks can help de-risk investments. 

3. Promote technology cooperation and transfer through regional and south-south partnerships. Vulnerable countries can learn from each other's experiences with decentralized and renewable energy programs.

4. Invest in grid infrastructure and regional connectivity to facilitate energy trading. This can improve energy security for landlocked developing countries in particular. 

5. Provide targeted support for "greening" the cooking fuel mix through clean cookstoves and fuels like biogas, ethanol and LPG. This can significantly improve public health and environment.

6. Improve data collection and monitoring frameworks to better track progress on energy access and renewable energy in vulnerable countries. More granular data at the local level is needed.

In conclusion, significant acceleration of action is needed across policies, partnerships, technology cooperation and finance in order to achieve SDG 7 in the world's poorest and most vulnerable countries. With the UN Decade of Sustainable Energy for All starting in 2021, now is the time for the international community to come together and ensure no one is left behind in the transition to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of UNCTAD targeting an expert audience with a focus on least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensuring Access to Affordable, Reliable, Sustainable and Modern Energy for All

Affordable and clean energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the world faces today. Access to energy is essential for eradicating poverty, improving public health, increasing productivity and economic opportunity, and mitigating climate change. Yet today, there are still nearly 1 billion people without access to electricity and 3 billion without access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking and heating. 

Progress on SDG 7 for the world’s most vulnerable countries including least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) remains slow and uneven. These countries face disproportionate challenges in achieving SDG 7 due to lack of access to technology and resources, high costs of energy infrastructure, and high reliance on imported fossil fuels. They require targeted international support and partnership to make progress.

Electricity access rates in LDCs averaged just 43% in 2018, far below the global average of 90%. More than 60% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa lacks access to electricity. In SIDS, access to affordable, reliable energy is hampered by high dependence on imported oil for electricity and transport, which contributes to volatile energy prices and energy insecurity. International oil price shocks can significantly impact these economies. LLDCs also face higher costs for energy due to lack of indigenous energy resources and the need to import energy over long distances. These higher costs are a major barrier to increasing energy access.

To accelerate progress on SDG 7 in vulnerable countries, the following actions are urgently needed:

1. Increase financing for decentralized renewable energy projects. Decentralized systems using solar, wind and hydropower can provide affordable access to energy for remote and rural populations. Targeted financing mechanisms are needed to support these projects.

2. Improve energy efficiency and demand-side management. Reducing overall energy demand through efficiency improvements in buildings, transport, and industry can lower costs and reduce the need for new energy infrastructure. Financial and technical support for demand-side management policies and programs is critical.  

3. Support regional energy connectivity and trade. Investing in cross-border energy infrastructure like power pools, transmission lines, and pipelines can help countries access cheaper and cleaner sources of energy from their neighbors. Regional cooperation on energy issues should be strongly promoted.  

4. Transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Many vulnerable countries rely heavily on imported coal, oil, and gas to meet their energy needs. Supporting a transition to solar, wind, hydropower and other renewable sources can increase energy security, reduce costs, and mitigate climate change. Financing and technology transfer for renewable energy projects should be scaled up significantly.

5. Improve data collection and monitoring. Many vulnerable countries lack robust data on energy access, consumption, and costs which hampers decision making and policy development. International support for energy data collection, analysis and sharing would enable countries to make evidence-based policy choices and track progress on SDG 7.

In summary, accelerated progress on SDG 7 in the world’s poorest and most vulnerable countries will require a coordinated global effort to mobilize financing, improve policy frameworks, build technical capacity, and foster international cooperation. Urgent action and partnership across governments, international organizations, civil society and the private sector are critical for ensuring affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.


 Here is a draft fictional analytical report on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) targeting an expert audience:

Progress on Sustainable Development Goal 7 in Africa: Challenges and Opportunities for Vulnerable Groups  

Access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy remains out of reach for a large proportion of the population in Africa, especially in least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries. Despite recent progress, 620 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa still lack access to electricity and 900 million lack access to clean cooking solutions. The poor state of energy access significantly impacts human development and economic growth in the region. 

To achieve SDG 7 by 2030, Africa must accelerate the transition to renewable energy and make rapid improvements in energy efficiency and access. However, renewable energy markets remain underdeveloped in most African countries due to lack of private sector investments, limited access to new technologies, and high costs of renewables compared to fossil fuels. Energy efficiency is similarly hindered by lack of awareness, financing and policy incentives. Vulnerable groups like small island states also face additional challenges from high dependence on imported fossil fuels and vulnerability to climate change impacts like stronger storms that threaten energy infrastructure.

Recent trends show promise but must be scaled up dramatically. The past decade has seen rapid growth in installed solar, wind and geothermal capacity in North and East Africa, but from a very low base. Micro-grids and off-grid renewable solutions are also extending access in remote and underserved areas. Energy efficiency policies and programs are growing but remain limited. To build on this progress, African governments should prioritize energy access and renewables in COVID-19 response and recovery plans. This could create jobs while transitioning economies to more sustainable energy systems. ECA recommends the following actions:

1. Increase financing for on-grid and off-grid renewable energy projects, especially for vulnerable groups. This could include dedicated funding windows, risk mitigation tools, and partnerships with private investors.  

2. Improve policy and regulatory environments for renewable energy and energy efficiency. This includes setting more ambitious targets, streamlining administrative processes, and providing tax and other incentives.

3. Invest in grid infrastructure and interconnections to integrate more renewable energy into national power systems. Cross-border power pools can also benefit smaller countries. 

4. Increase technical capacity and skills training on renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies across the region.  

5. Raise public awareness about the benefits of sustainable energy and energy conservation through education and community engagement campaigns.

With concerted efforts across African countries to tackle these challenges, the vision of SDG 7 can be achieved. Vulnerable groups especially stand to benefit from increased sustainable energy access, which can power critical infrastructure, healthcare facilities, schools, agricultural activities and small businesses. Overall, progress on SDG 7 will be vital to build a more equitable, resilient and sustainable future for all Africans.


 Here is a draft long-form analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Europe, focused on least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries:

Sustainable Development Goal 7 calls for “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.” This goal aims to drive progress on clean and renewable energy access for the populations that need it most. Progress on SDG 7 will be crucial for the world’s poorest and most vulnerable populations, especially those in least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries.  

According to the UN, as of 2018, an estimated 840 million people still do not have access to electricity, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia. Many more who do have access to electricity cannot afford to use it reliably due to high costs. The populations in least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries face some of the biggest energy access deficits, with rural and remote populations being particularly underserved. Providing universal access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy in these countries will be challenging but essential to enable progress on reducing poverty and improving well-being.

Renewable energy sources like solar and wind offer promising solutions for least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries. The costs of solar and wind have declined dramatically in recent years, making them far more affordable and viable options. Many of these countries also have abundant renewable resource potential, especially for solar and geothermal energy. However, renewable energy projects require upfront capital costs that can be prohibitive. The international community will need to increase financing and technology transfer for renewable energy in these countries to enable progress. Partnerships with private companies and investors will also be key.

Improving energy efficiency is another important strategy for least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries to make progress on SDG 7. Reducing waste and improving the efficiency of energy usage can generate energy savings and reduce costs, making energy more affordable and available to more people.  Policies and programs to mandate and incentivize energy efficiency across sectors like transportation, buildings, and industry can significantly improve energy access in these countries at a lower cost. However, policy makers will need support in developing and implementing ambitious energy efficiency plans and standards.

In summary, least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries face major challenges in achieving SDG 7 due to a lack of energy access, high costs, and dependence on fossil fuels. However, renewable energy and energy efficiency offer promising and low-cost strategies for these countries to make progress on affordable and clean energy for all. With increased international support for finance, technology, policy, and partnerships, these countries can achieve and even leapfrog traditional energy pathways to build sustainable energy systems that drive development, reduce poverty, and power opportunity for generations to come. Overall, accelerating progress on SDG 7 is critical for these vulnerable populations and our shared goals of sustainability and equity.


 Here is a draft long-form analytical report on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) targeting an expert audience:

SDG 7: Ensuring Access to Affordable, Reliable, Sustainable and Modern Energy for All

Access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy is essential for achieving sustainable development and eradicating poverty. SDG 7 aims to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all" by 2030. For the least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), achievement of this goal by 2030 remains an immense challenge. 

As of 2018, 770 million people around the world still lack access to electricity. The vast majority live in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia, including in LDCs and SIDS with limited energy infrastructure. Providing universal access will require substantial investment in the expansion of transmission and distribution lines, as well as off-grid and mini-grid solutions for remote areas. Financing this expansion has proved difficult, with annual investments in energy access running well below the $50-60 billion/year needed. In LDCs and SIDS, foreign direct investment in the energy sector has remained low due to high risks. To achieve universal access, governments and development partners will need to focus efforts on mobilizing private finance and providing targeted subsidies and other incentives.

Even when people gain access to electricity, the supply is often unreliable. In many developing countries, including in Central Africa, South Asia and island nations, blackouts and brownouts are common, with adverse effects on health, education, and economic opportunity. Upgrading existing infrastructure and diversifying energy sources to include more renewable energy can help improve reliability, as can regional power pools that share electricity across borders. New "smart grid" technologies also show promise for improving efficiency and reliability, but countries will need technology and skills transfers to adopt them. 

To meet the broader objectives of SDG 7, the world must accelerate the transition to affordable, sustainable and modern energy. The share of renewable energy in the global energy mix reached 17.5% in 2018, still well below the target of substantially increasing the share of renewable energy set out in SDG target 7.2. While renewable energy has expanded rapidly in some regions thanks to falling costs and government incentives, growth has lagged in others, including in many LDCs and SIDS. Barriers include lack of access to technology and finance, as well as challenges integrating renewable energy into existing grids. 
 
In conclusion, despite some progress, the world remains off track to achieve SDG 7, especially for vulnerable country groups in Latin America and the Caribbean region. Concerted global efforts are urgently needed to mobilize financing, spur innovation, and build technical capacities to provide affordable, reliable and sustainable energy for all, leaving no one behind. By accelerating action on SDG 7, we can drive progress across the 2030 Agenda and build a just, equitable and prosperous future for both current and future generations.


 Here is a draft detailed analytical report on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), focused on least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries:

Access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy is crucial for achieving economic growth, increasing productivity and improving the well-being of populations across the Asia-Pacific region, especially for the poorest and most disadvantaged countries and communities. Despite significant progress, Asia and the Pacific continues to face major challenges in achieving SDG 7. Nearly 440 million people across the region still lack access to electricity and more than 1.1 billion people lack access to clean cooking fuels and technologies. 

The challenges are most acute in least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS) and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) in the region which continue to have some of the lowest rates of access to modern energy services in the world. These vulnerable groups of countries face significant structural difficulties including limited domestic energy resources, small economies of scale, low incomes and fiscal capacities, and heavy dependence on imported fossil fuels. They are also disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change despite contributing little to global greenhouse gas emissions.

Accelerating progress on SDG 7 will require major policy, technology and financing interventions tailored to the specific needs and contexts of these vulnerable countries. This includes providing targeted support for renewable energy expansion, energy efficiency improvements, development of domestic energy sources where feasible, and access to international climate finance mechanisms and overseas development assistance. Regional cooperation on cross-border energy connectivity and trade could also help LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs access affordable and reliable energy resources.

ESCAP has been working with member States and partners to strengthen regional cooperation on sustainable energy in the Asia-Pacific region, including through the establishment of the Committee on Energy under the broader Conference structure. ESCAP also provides a platform for members States to share best practices on energy policy, technology and financing for LDCs, SIDS and LLDCs. However, increased financial and technical support from development partners will be critical to accelerating progress on SDG 7 across all vulnerable groups of countries in the region, especially in the midst of an ongoing global health and economic crisis. Overall, urgent action is needed to ensure that no one is left behind in the transition to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.


 Here is a draft fictional detailed analytical report on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in the style of ESCWA targeting an expert audience:

SDG 7: Progress on Affordable and Clean Energy in Vulnerable Countries  

Access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy is crucial for the development of vulnerable countries including the least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries. Despite some progress, nearly 800 million people still lack access to electricity and clean cooking fuels and technologies according to the 2018 tracking report by UN DESA. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated existing inequalities and vulnerabilities in the energy sector. Urgent action is needed to improve energy access and transition to renewable energy to achieve SDG 7 by 2030.   

Progress on expanding energy access has been uneven across regions. In sub-Saharan Africa, over 570 million people lack access to electricity. Population growth continues to outpace gains in electrification. Small island developing states face high costs of fuel importation and challenges in transitioning to renewable energy sources due to lack of economies of scale. For many landlocked developing countries, lack of energy infrastructure and over-reliance on biomass fuels remains a key barrier. Affordability of electricity and clean cooking fuels is a major challenge for the poorest populations. Targeted policies and investments are needed to provide affordable and sustainable energy access for the most vulnerable groups.  

The share of renewable energy in the global energy mix needs to increase substantially to meet the SDG 7 target. Renewable energy use has grown over the years, but largely in more developed countries. The renewable energy share in sub-Saharan Africa was only 11% of total final energy consumption in 2017 according to ESCWA estimates. Small island developing states have significant potential for solar and wind energy, but face difficulties in mobilizing investments. Many landlocked developing countries rely heavily on imported petroleum products due to lack of domestic energy resources.  Transitioning to renewable energy can increase energy security, but requires technology transfer, capacity building and financial support. 

In conclusion, vulnerable countries remain far from achieving universal access to affordable and clean energy by 2030. Targeted policy and investment are urgently needed to improve energy access for the poorest populations, scale up renewable energy and enhance energy efficiency. Regional cooperation and global partnerships can play an important role in addressing energy challenges in least developed countries, small island developing states and landlocked developing countries. With increased efforts, SDG 7 can be achieved, contributing to sustainable development for all.
