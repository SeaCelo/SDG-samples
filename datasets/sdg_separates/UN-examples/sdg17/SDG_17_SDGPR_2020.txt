Strengthening global partnerships and enhancing the means of implementing the Goals have remained a challenge owing to scarce financial resources, trade tensions, technological obstacles and a lack of data. The pandemic is adding hardships to the implementation of the Goals. As COVID-19 continues to spread, global financial markets have experienced great losses and intense volatility, and more than $100 billion in capital has flowed out of emerging markets since the outbreak, the largest outflow ever recorded. World trade is expected to plunge by between 13 and 32 per cent in 2020. Strengthening multilateralism and global partnerships is more important than ever before. The global nature of the pandemic requires the participation of all governments, the private sector, civil society organizations and people throughout the world.	
	
	Finance
	
Net ODA flows totalled $147 billion in 2019, nearly the same level as in 2018, but with an increased share going to the neediest countries. Bilateral ODA to least developed countries rose by 3 per cent in real terms since 2018, with aid to Africa rising by 1 per cent, but humanitarian aid fell by 3 per cent.	
Global foreign direct investment (FDI) flows continued to slide, falling by 13 per cent, from a revised $1.5 trillion in 2017 to $1.3 trillion in 2018. The decline, the third consecutive annual decrease in FDI, was mainly a result of large repatriations of accumulated foreign earnings by multinational enterprises following tax reforms introduced at the end of 2017. It is projected that the pandemic may cause global FDI to shrink by 30 to 40 per cent in the period 2020–2022.	
Remittance flows to lower-middle-income countries are estimated to have reached $554 billion in 2019, exceeding official aid by a factor of three since the mid-1990s. In 2019, remittances overtook FDI flows to lower-middle-income countries, according to estimates. However, growth in remittance flows slowed to 4.7 per cent in 2019, compared with a robust 8.6 per cent in 2018. Global remittances are projected to fall to $445 billion, or by 20 per cent, in 2020 owing to the pandemic.	
Globally, government revenue accounted for approximately 30 per cent of GDP in 2018, remaining stable compared with previous years, but with wide variation among countries. The average overall tax burden (revenue in the form of taxes) was 25 per cent of GDP among advanced economies and 17 per cent of GDP among emerging markets and developing economies. The overall average of the proportion of government expenditure funded by taxes was about 65 per cent among advanced economies and 60 per cent among emerging market economies.	
	
	Information and communications technology
	
More than half of the world’s population is now online. At the end of 2019, 53.6 per cent of individuals, or 4.1 billion persons, were using the Internet, ranging from only 20 per cent in Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) and 26 per cent in sub-Saharan African to 84 per cent in Europe and Northern America and 87 per cent in Australia and New Zealand.	
Fixed broadband subscriptions are increasing continuously. Globally, there were nearly 15 fixed broadband subscriptions for every 100 inhabitants in 2019, ranging from 33.6 in developed countries to only 11.2 in developing countries. In least developed countries, owing to the high cost and lack of infrastructure, there were nearly no fixed broadband connections. From a health, economic and social perspective, this digital divide is costing developing countries and their peoples dearly during the pandemic.	
	
	Capacity-building
	
Total ODA for capacity-building and national planning stood at $33.5 billion in 2017, representing 14 per cent of total sector allocable aid, stable since 2010. The main sectors assisted were public administration, energy and finance, which received a total of $13.0 billion.	
	
	Trade
	
Trade-weighted tariffs worldwide declined, from 2.2 per cent in 2017 to an average of 2.1 per cent in 2018.	
The share of exports of least developed countries in global merchandise trade remained marginal, at just over 1 per cent in 2018. Growth in global exports of least developed countries stagnated over the past decade, missing the target of doubling the share of global exports of least developed countries by 2020 from 2011. In 2018, least developed countries recorded significant year-on-year growth in services exports, reaching a global share of 0.8 per cent. The share of global services exports of developing regions has flattened in past years, amounting to a share of 30 per cent at the end of 2018.	
	
	Data, monitoring and accountability
	
In 2019, 132 countries reported having national statistical legislation that was compliant with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, up from 111 countries in 2018.	
In 2019, 141 countries reported having implemented a national statistical plan, up from 129 countries in 2018. Although it had the second highest number of countries (36) implementing national statistical plans, sub-Saharan Africa had the lowest percentage of fully funded plans, with only 25 per cent of plans fully funded, compared with 95 per cent in Northern America and Europe.	
In 2017, countries received $689 million in support from multilateral and bilateral donors for all areas of statistics, up from $623 million in 2016. However, that amount accounted for only 0.34 per cent of total ODA. International funding for data and statistics was at only around half the level at which it needed to be.	
In the period 2014–2018, 147 countries had birth registration data that were at least 90 per cent complete, and 153 countries had death registration data that were at least 75 per cent complete. In sub-Saharan Africa, 28 of 53 countries had birth registration data, and only 23 of 53 countries had death registration data.
