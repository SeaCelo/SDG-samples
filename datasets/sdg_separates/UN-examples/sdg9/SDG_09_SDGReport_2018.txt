Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
CO2 emissions intensity (kg CO2/USD)

Global carbon intensity decreased by 19 per cent between 2000
and 2015

Proportion of population covered by a 3G mobile broadband network was lower in the LDCs in 2016

Steady progress has been made in the manufacturing industry. To achieve inclusive and sustainable industrialization, competitive economic forces need to be unleashed to generate employment and income, facilitate international trade and enable the efficient use of resources.
fThe global share of manufacturing value added in GDP increased from 15.2 per cent in 2005 to 16.3 per cent in 2017, driven by the fast growth of manufacturing in Asia.
fGlobally, the carbon intensity decreased by 19 per cent from 2000 to 2015â€” from 0.38 to 0.31 kilograms of carbon dioxide per dollar of value added.
fIn 2015, medium-high- and high-technology sectors accounted for 44.7 per cent of total manufacturing value added globally. The value added reached 34.6 per cent in developing economies, up from 21.5 per cent in 2005.
fBy 2016, the proportion of the population covered by a third generation (3G) mobile broadband network stood at 61 per cent in the LDCs and 84 per cent globally.
