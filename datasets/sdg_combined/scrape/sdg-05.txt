GOAL 5: GENDER EQUALITY Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls Goal 5 aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. Gender equality is a human right. It is also a precondition for realizing all goals in the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. Though girls and boys on average face similar challenges in early childhood, gender disparities become more pronounced as children grow. Adolescent girls, due to expected gender roles, may face a disproportionate burden of domestic work, expectations to be married, risks of early pregnancy, as well as sexual and gender-based violence. Globally, 650 million girls and women alive today have been and over 200 million have undergone female genital mutilation. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has deepened existing gender inequalities, especially for the most marginalized children. UNICEF’s contribution towards reaching Goal 5 centres on embedding gender equitable results across all programming to ensure that children grow, learn and thrive, regardless of their gender. UNICEF places a special focus on adolescent girls in recognition that investment in adolescent girls has the potential to bring about transformative change for girls, their families and their communities, as well as for the next generation. UNICEF also supports governments in generating, analysing and using gender data to identify and address barriers to gender equality among children and women. UNICEF is the custodian for global monitoring for two indicators that measure progress towards Goal 5: Indicator 5.3.1 Proportion of women aged 20–24 years who were married or in a union before age 15 and before age 18; and Indicator 5.3.2 Proportion of girls and women aged 15–49 years who have undergone female genital mutilation/cutting, by age. UNICEF is also co-custodian for two Goal 5 indicators: Indicator 5.2.1 Proportion of ever-partnered women and girls aged 15 years and older subjected to physical, sexual or psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months, by form of violence and by age; and Indicator 5.2.2 Proportion of women and girls aged 15 years and older subjected to sexual violence by persons other than an intimate partner in the previous 12 months, by age and place of occurrence. In addition, UNICEF is the custodian or co-custodian of four additional sex-disaggregated or gender-specific child focused indicators under Goals 3, 4, 8 and 16: Child-related SDG indicators TARGET 5.2 Eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation Intimate partner violence includes any physical, sexual or emotional abuse perpetrated by a current or former partner within the context of marriage, cohabitation or any other formal or informal union. Although both girls and boys can be victims of intimate partner violence, girls are at greater risk. Given prevailing social norms that sanction male dominance over women, violence between intimate partners is often perceived as an ordinary or normal element of relationships, particularly in the context of marriage or other unions. In fact, violence directed at girls and women by an intimate partner is the most common form of gender-based violence. This indicator refers to intimate partner violence, which includes any abuse perpetrated by a current or former partner within the context of marriage, cohabitation or any other formal or informal union. For the purpose of global monitoring, the indicator is currently being defined as proportion of ever-partnered women and girls aged 15 to 49 years who have experienced physical or sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months. The rationale for using a proxy indicator is that comparable data are currently only available for a subset of girls and women aged 15 to 49 years and the fact that there is no agreement on a standard operational definition for psychological violence. The conceptual definitions of the types of violence covered in the SDG indicator, as defined in the 2014 UN Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women, are: ‘Physical violence’ consists of acts aimed at physically hurting the victim and include, but are not limited to acts like pushing, grabbing, twisting the arm, pulling hair, slapping, kicking, biting or hitting with a fist or object, trying to strangle or suffocate, burning or scalding on purpose, or threatening or attacking with some sort of weapon, gun or knife. ‘Sexual violence’ is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behaviour that is imposed on someone, whether by use of force, intimidation or coercion. It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts without consent, non-contact acts such as being forced to watch or participate in pornography, etc. In intimate partner relationships, sexual violence is commonly defined as: being physically forced to have sexual intercourse, having sexual intercourse out of fear for what the partner might do or through coercion, and/or being forced to do something sexual that the woman considers humiliating or degrading. ‘Psychological violence’ includes a range of behaviours that encompass acts of emotional abuse and controlling conduct. Numerator: Number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) who have experienced physical, sexual and/or psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months. Denominator: Number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) in the population. It is important to note that because of the stigma surrounding intimate partner violence, available data are likely to underestimate the true prevalence. The availability of comparable data remains a challenge as many data collection efforts have relied on varying survey methodologies, not used the same definitions of partner or spousal violence and of the forms of violence, utilized different survey questions, and sampled diverse age groups. The quality of interviewer training is also highly variable. Because of this, data should be interpreted with caution. Currently, national data included in the global SDG database are disaggregated only by age (when possible) but not by type of violence, as called for in the indicator definition. This is because, while there is global consensus on how physical and sexual intimate partner violence are generally defined and measured, psychological partner violence is conceptualized differently across cultures and in different contexts. In addition, the indicator definition makes reference to experiences of intimate partner violence by ever-partnered women aged 15 years and older. However, a majority of the available data have only been collected for a subset of girls and women aged 15 to 49 years, and there is a general lack of consistency in the age range of sample populations across other available sources. Therefore, global reporting on this indicator at this moment only reflects violence experienced by ever-partnered girls and women aged 15 to 49 years. Click on the button below to explore the data behind this indicator. Sexual violence directed at women and girls represents one manifestation of gender inequality and is symptomatic of the widely held view that girls and women have low status in society and are expected to comply with and conform to certain defined gender roles. While sexual violence may take different forms and occur in many settings, this indicator is limited to sexual violence perpetrated by individuals other than an intimate partner. Having data on this indicator will help to better understand the extent and nature of this form of violence and to inform the development of appropriate policies and programmes for prevention and response. This indicator refers to the proportion of women and girls aged 15 years and older who have experienced sexual violence by persons other than an intimate partner, in the previous 12 months. The indicator is limited to sexual violence perpetrated by individuals other than an intimate partner. The conceptual definition of sexual violence covered by the SDG indicator, as defined in the 2014 UN Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women is: “Any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behaviour that is imposed on someone. It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts with a woman without her consent, sexual harassment, verbal abuse, threats, exposure, unwanted touching, incest, etc.” However, in most surveys that collect data on sexual violence against women and girls by non-partners, the operational definition is limited to forced sexual intercourse or other forced sexual acts and attempted or coerced sexual intercourse or other sexual acts. Numerator: Number of women and girls (aged 15 years and above) who have experienced sexual violence by a non-intimate partner in the previous 12 months Denominator: Number of women and girls (aged 15 years and above) in the population The availability of comparable data remains a challenge as many data collection efforts have relied on different survey methodologies and used varying definitions of sexual violence as well as survey questions to elicit information. Diverse age groups are also often utilized. Additionally, not all surveys on violence against women collect information on non-partner violence. Respondents’ willingness to discuss experiences of violence and understanding of relevant concepts may also differ according to how a survey is implemented and the cultural context, and this can affect reported prevalence levels. Efforts and investment are required to develop an internationally agreed standard and definition of sexual violence by non-partners that will enable comparison across countries. Monitoring this indicator with certain periodicity may be a challenge if sustained capacities are not built. Click on the button below to explore the data behind this indicator. TARGET 5.3 Eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation Child marriage is a harmful practice that violates the rights and impairs the well-being of children. The SDG framework includes child marriage under the goal for gender equality, acknowledging that child marriage can be seen as a manifestation of gender inequality, reflecting societal values that hold girls in low esteem and deprive them of agency. Although indicator 5.3.1 measures child marriage among girls, the practice occurs among boys as well, and is a breach of children’s rights regardless of sex. Child marriage is addressed in a number of international conventions and agreements and is prohibited by national legislation in many countries. This indicator intends to measure the prevalence of child marriage, that is, how widespread the practice is in the population. This indicator is defined as the proportion of women aged 20 to 24 years who were first married or living in a cohabiting union as if married before age 15 and before age 18. The prevalence of child marriage is measured retrospectively among women whose risk of marrying in childhood is complete, i.e., those who are at least 18 years old, and the age group of 20 to 24 years is used by convention to represent the current prevalence of the practice. Both formal (i.e., marriages) and informal unions are covered under this indicator. Informal unions are generally defined as those in which a couple lives together as if married but for which there has been no formal civil or religious ceremony (i.e., cohabitation). The term child marriage is used to refer to unions in which a girl or boy lives with a partner as if married before the age of 18, though the SDG indicator captures only child marriage among girls. Numerator: Number of women aged 20 to 24 years who were first married or in union before age 15 (or before age 18). Denominator: Total number of women aged 20 to 24 years in the population. The measure of child marriage is retrospective in nature by design, capturing age at first marriage among a population that has completed the risk period (i.e., adult women). While it is also possible to measure the current marital status of girls under age 18, such measures would provide an underestimate of the level of child marriage, as girls who are not currently married may still do so before they turn 18. Click on the button below to explore the data behind this indicator. FGM is a harmful practice that violates the rights and impairs the well-being of girls. In communities where it is practised, it can be seen as a direct manifestation of gender inequality, reflecting societal values that hold girls in low esteem and deprive them of agency. Thus, in the SDG framework the target of eliminating harmful practices is placed under the goal for gender equality. FGM is addressed in a number of international conventions and agreements and is prohibited by national legislation in many countries. This indicator intends to measure the prevalence of female genital mutilation, that is, how widespread the practice is in the population. Percentage of girls and women (aged 15-49 years) who have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM) FGM refers to “all procedures involving partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for nonmedical reasons.” The term female circumcision is often used interchangeably with FGM, although some object to this term as it erroneously suggests that female circumcision is analogous to male circumcision. Numerator: Number of girls and women aged 15 to 49 years who have undergone FGM. Denominator: Total number of girls and women aged 15 to 49 years in the population. Data users should also keep in mind the retrospective nature of these data, which results in this indicator not being sensitive to recent change. In countries where girls are cut before 1 year of age, for example, most girls aged 15 to 19 years are reporting on an event that took place 14 to 18 years earlier. Thus, there is a time lag between when changes in the practice occur and when they are reflected in the data. Furthermore, in terms of understanding the prevalence, it may be misleading to focus on national-level estimates, as in many countries FGM is practised by specific ethnic groups that may be concentrated in certain geographic locations in the country. In MICS and DHS, questions about FGM are only included in a subset of countries where the practice is concentrated. Thus, it is important to note that even in countries with no FGM data, the practice still may exist. This may include high-income countries that are destinations for migrants from countries where the practice still occurs, as well as certain low- and middle-income countries in which FGM exists among specific population groups.

Science and technology centers represent key opportunities for informal, hands-on learning around science and technology. They communicate not only the fundamentals of STEM, but also how STEM connects to the everyday and real world. This makes STEM more relatable and inspiring and makes the ever-important connection between science and society. Moreover, science and technology centers can engage both young people and their families and community. These intergenerational and broader links are especially critical in ensuring girls are supported in pursuing STEM learning and careers and that boys and men see a natural role for girls and women in these sectors. Breaking down stereotypes around girls and women in STEM is essential. and science and technology centers are also well placed to do just this.

Breaking down stereotypes around girls and women in STEM is essential. and science and technology centers are also well placed to do just this. ISCSMD and the Women and Girls in Science Global Marathon are opportunities to highlight the important role of women and girls in STEM, to celebrate the work that is being done within ASTC’s membership to encourage girls and women in STEM, and to build momentum for acceleration of this work and stronger partnerships in this critical area. Why is it important to highlight the role of women in addressing the world’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)? Women are not only half the world’s population but are also often disproportionately affected by many of the global challenges we face. This positions them with a unique set of experiences, needs, and perspectives that must be recognized and addressed as we seek to realize a more just and sustainable future. Women—both young and old—are sources of knowledge, expertise, and solutions that must also be better supported and tapped. STEM underlies each and every one of the SDGs—from the use of digital technology for political engagement, to meeting health and environmental challenges, to economic empowerment, to modeling forms of international collaboration. Currently, women are significantly underrepresented in STEM in both private and public sectors, including in STEM education, professions, enterprise, and policymaking, and from entry level through to leadership positions. Therefore, we are missing a set of critical priorities, a broad pool of talent, and the greater success and innovation that diversity brings. This is untenable and deprives both women and society of tremendous gains and, until remedied, will hinder achievement of the SDGs. How does Goal 5 (Gender Equality) contribute to achieving the other SDGs? The SDGs are interlinked and indivisible with a broader goal of achieving peaceful, just, and inclusive societies. Women’s empowerment and gender equality are essential to achieving all of Agenda 2030. This is reinforced by the fact that issues and targets around gender equality are reflected throughout the agenda in addition to there being a specific goal—Goal 5—on gender equality. Goal 5 specifically speaks to the transformation of unequal power relations between women and men and underlying structural issues around gender equality. It commits to action around violence against women, all forms of discrimination, harmful practices, social and economic policies, women’s leadership, SHR, and overall national strategies on gender equality. However, Goal 5 also supports realization of the other goals, all of which have a gender dimension. Girls and women have differentiated experiences when it comes to all of the SDGs and this lens needs to inform their implementation. It is also worth noting that the goal on gender includes a target (5b) on women’s use of enabling technology, including ICTs, as a means of implementing the goal. This also reinforces the direct link between women, science, and technology for achieving all the SDGs. Take the issue of energy—Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy)—as an example. UN Women notes that women disproportionately bear the burden of energy poverty in that when modern energy sources are not available women spend hours each day collecting fuel to cook and heat their homes. This affects 2.9 billion homes globally. The result is that women and girls are not engaged in school, other income earning activities, or even leisure. Moreover, they also face significant health and safety risks from household air pollution and carrying heavy loads. At the same time, women’s position in the formal energy sector where solutions and policy are being developed is at 20%, with women in leadership positions even lower. There is a significant disconnect that speaks to the need to address the structural issues in Goal 5, gender specific policies and actions taken under Goal 7, as well as broader issues around girls and women in STEM. Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) also supports the other goals. Target 9.C speaks to access to information and communication technology and the internet by 2020. The ability of women to access and participate in the digital revolution has implications for their ability to contribute to and benefit from political engagement, health care, education, economic empowerment, and almost all spheres of public and private life, which increasingly have a digital component, e.g., access to information, services, and other opportunities, and in voice and mobilization. The commitment under Goal 5b to advance women’s use of ICTs directs attention to necessary investments in ensuring that there are more girls and women in the ICT sector, as well as policy and applications being developed that speak to women’s needs and issues of gender equality. An equitable 21st century infrastructure and related services will require acceleration of women’s digital equality. At present, women make up a low percentage of women in technical positions in the ICT sector at around 20% globally and, for example, the EU has noted that only 9% of apps in the region are developed by women. What role does STEM education play in achieving the SDGs? Ensuring that more women are fully engaged in application of STEM for achieving the SDGs requires an ecosystem approach. There are many actors dedicated to ensuring that girls and women are successful in STEM, spanning from early learning through higher education, to more equitable and gender responsive work places and R&D, to government policies and investments. Within this ecosystem, however, the role of education is paramount. This includes both formal and, critically, informal education. The SDGs specifically speak to gender equality in all aspects and levels of education (Goal 4, Quality Education), including in some STEM-related areas (math, ICT, sustainability, technical training). We must equip the next generation of girls and boys with the foundations, tools, and understanding to pursue STEM that will support achievement of the SDGs. There are currently large gaps globally in girls’ access to formal and informal quality education and particularly STEM education. The informal STEM learning space, such as that offered by ASTC’s members, can serve as a complement for girls and young women when there are gaps in formal education. It also has a nimble ability to recalibrate and build learning content and opportunities that better speak to girls and young women and their learning interests and needs. For example, research shows that often young women are more attracted to STEM when it is purpose driven, connected to real life, and experiential. It is here in particular that science and technology centers can play an important role as they often are tackling issues embodied in Agenda 2030. The Marathon is an opportunity to help to highlight some of the existing good practices on engagement of girls and young women that can be replicated within other centers. However, though broader partnerships, it will also be important to continue to expand these opportunities to girls within communities where such centers don’t exist, as well as to integrate the content and lessons from the informal space into formal education including with teacher networks. How is working to address the SDGs? Achieving the SDGs is at the core of UN Women’s mission and it plays a central role in monitoring and reporting around Goal 5. UN Women works through three primary channels supporting governments and other stakeholders at the national level in implementation of the goals through operational programmes advocacy around normative frameworks and policy, including the annual Commission on the Status of Women coordination work within the UN system. UN Women tackles issues of women in STEM primarily through its economic empowerment work, including through global partnerships on ICT; through 21st century and digital literacy skill development, promoting women in non-traditional sectors (such as STEM) for decent work; and around applications such as energy, agriculture, and rural development. Global initiatives include partnerships with UNOOSA to promote women in the space sector UNESCO and WIPO to examine the relationship between gender equality and STEM through future foresight methodologies for policy making UNESCO to promote Women in Science Day ITU under the Equals initiative to promote equality in the digital age UN Women also works with civil society partners like the Web Foundation where it supported the development of a Gender Digital Scorecard for national policy makers. Under its innovation work, UN Women works to advance women as innovators through private sector partnerships. Most recently UN Women has established a task force on Youth and STEM as part of the UN Inter-agency Network on Youth Development’s Working Group on Youth and Gender Equality, which will engage civil society and other partners that work with young women led or focused groups to increase the voice of young women and their leadership around STEM policy and strategies, to build their STEM related learning opportunities and skills development, and to position young women as creators of STEM based SDG solutions. For more information on what UN Women does, . How is Futuristas working in support of the SDGs? Futuristas is part of the movement to change the way STEAM is perceived, experienced, and directed. This includes how STEAM links to a better society and realization of the SDGs. Its particular focus is on demonstrating how STEAM can help youth realize their passions and goals, no matter where they lie. Futuristas seeks to make a difference by 1) Mainstreaming STEAM experiential learning and application where youth are already engaged and around their areas of interest (from social justice, to arts, to the environment, to sport and all range of subjects) 2) Connecting this broader pool of STEAM engaged youth to more advanced skill providers, e.g., coding and engineering organizations 3) Equipping youth with skills to understand, analyze, and build a preferred future through a STEAM lens by utilizing tools such as foresight/future and systems thinking, ethics, as well change-making and communication. This mission is undertaken through collaboration with a range of partners including educational institutions, community organizations and clubs, industries, advocacy organizations, and many other sectors. In line with Goal 5, Futuristas has a strong and dedicated focus on girls and young women and also works with partners, including the UN system, in promoting a broader STEAM ecosystem that supports gender equality. Futuristas is a co-lead, alongside UN Women, of the UN Inter-agency Network on Youth Development’s Working Group on Youth and Gender Equality’s STEM Task Force. , , ,

UN Women tackles issues of women in STEM primarily through its economic empowerment work, including through global partnerships on ICT; through 21st century and digital literacy skill development, promoting women in non-traditional sectors (such as STEM) for decent work; and around applications such as energy, agriculture, and rural development. Global initiatives include partnerships with UNOOSA to promote women in the space sector UNESCO and WIPO to examine the relationship between gender equality and STEM through future foresight methodologies for policy making UNESCO to promote Women in Science Day ITU under the Equals initiative to promote equality in the digital age UN Women also works with civil society partners like the Web Foundation where it supported the development of a Gender Digital Scorecard for national policy makers. Under its innovation work, UN Women works to advance women as innovators through private sector partnerships. Most recently UN Women has established a task force on Youth and STEM as part of the UN Inter-agency Network on Youth Development’s Working Group on Youth and Gender Equality, which will engage civil society and other partners that work with young women led or focused groups to increase the voice of young women and their leadership around STEM policy and strategies, to build their STEM related learning opportunities and skills development, and to position young women as creators of STEM based SDG solutions. For more information on what UN Women does, . How is Futuristas working in support of the SDGs? Futuristas is part of the movement to change the way STEAM is perceived, experienced, and directed. This includes how STEAM links to a better society and realization of the SDGs. Its particular focus is on demonstrating how STEAM can help youth realize their passions and goals, no matter where they lie. Futuristas seeks to make a difference by 1) Mainstreaming STEAM experiential learning and application where youth are already engaged and around their areas of interest (from social justice, to arts, to the environment, to sport and all range of subjects) 2) Connecting this broader pool of STEAM engaged youth to more advanced skill providers, e.g., coding and engineering organizations 3) Equipping youth with skills to understand, analyze, and build a preferred future through a STEAM lens by utilizing tools such as foresight/future and systems thinking, ethics, as well change-making and communication. This mission is undertaken through collaboration with a range of partners including educational institutions, community organizations and clubs, industries, advocacy organizations, and many other sectors. In line with Goal 5, Futuristas has a strong and dedicated focus on girls and young women and also works with partners, including the UN system, in promoting a broader STEAM ecosystem that supports gender equality. Futuristas is a co-lead, alongside UN Women, of the UN Inter-agency Network on Youth Development’s Working Group on Youth and Gender Equality’s STEM Task Force. , , ,
